## Project 4 Proposal

2020 has been a rough year for health care professionals. Not only is the healthcare community working on the front lines of the pandemic, but they are under siege from many sides. They have to struggle to convince everyday citizens to wear masks and socially distance. They are overworked and pressured into working in a system that doesn't prioritize their own safety (limited PPE for example).

For my project, I'm interested in exploring how the healthcare community feels about everything that's going on. How are they feeling about the pandemic and how have their feelings changed throughout 2020?

For my dataset, I will scrape the top posts made on the r/medicine subreddit for each month of 2020. For context, the r/medicine subreddit is specifically made for medical professionals to talk about the latest medical advances, discuss any controversies, and have a shared lounge to converse, chat, and vent.

I would like to explore the following most specifically:

1. Explore how the sentiment of posts have changed through the course of 2020. Have posts been generally more negative? For posts that are positive, what are they about?
2. Use topic modeling to explore what topics the medical community is worried about. Besides the pandemic, what other issues are being brought up? How has the pandemic impacted life as a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional?
