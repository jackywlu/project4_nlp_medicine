      "**THIS SUBREDDIT IS FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS.** /r/medicine is a virtual lounge for physicians and other medical professionals from around the world to talk about the latest advances, controversies, ask questions of each other, have a laugh, or share a difficult moment. This is a highly moderated subreddit. Please read the rules carefully before posting or commenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Subreddit Rules\n",
      "\n",
      "_Violations will be dealt with by some combination of warning, comment/post removal, temporary ban, or permanent ban based on moderator discretion._\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. All posts require user flair. Link posts require a starter comment:** An [appropriate user flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/wiki/faq) must be chosen prior to attempting to post in order to contextualize the post and demonstrate a minimum effort to follow subreddit rules. All link posts require a starter comment to explain why the link is of interest to the community and to start the conversation. Posts without user flair will be immediately filtered, and link posts without starter comments will be temporarily or permanently removed upon discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. No requests for professional advice or general medical information:** This is not a question-and-answer forum such as /r/askreddit. You may not solicit medical advice or share personal health anecdotes about yourself, family, acquaintances, or celebrities, seek comments on care provided by other clinicians, discuss billing disputes, or otherwise seek a professional opinion from members of the subreddit. General queries about medical conditions, prognosis, drugs, or other medical topics from the lay public are not allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. No promotions, advertisements, surveys, or petitions:** Surveys (formal or informal) and polls are not allowed on this subreddit. You may not use the subreddit to promote your website, channel, subreddit, or product. Market research is not allowed. Petitions are not allowed. Advertising or spam may result in a permanent ban. Prior permission is required before posting educational material you were involved in making.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Link to high-quality, original research whenever possible:** Posts which rely on or reference scientific data (e.g. an announcement about a medical breakthrough) should link to the original research in peer-reviewed medical journals or respectable news sources as judged by the moderators. Avoid login or paywall requirements when possible. Please submit direct links to PDFs as text/self posts with the link in the text. Sensationalized titles, misrepresentation of results, or promotion of blatantly bad science may lead to removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Act professionally and decently:** /r/medicine is a public forum that represents the medical community and comments should reflect this. Please keep disagreement civil and focused on issues. Trolling, abuse, and insults (either personal or aimed at a specific group) are not allowed. Do not attack other users' flair. Keep offensive language to a minimum and do not use ethnic, sexual, or other slurs. Posts, comments, or private messages violating Reddit's content policy will be removed and reported to site administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. No personal agendas:** Users who primarily post or comment on a single pet issue on this subreddit (as judged by moderators) will be asked to broaden participation or leave. Comments from users who appear on this subreddit only to discuss a specific political topic, medical condition, health care role, or similar single-topic issues will be removed. Comments which deviate from the topic of a thread to interject an unrelated personal opinion (e.g. politics) or steer the conversation to their pet issue will be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Protect patient confidentiality:** Posting protected health information may result in an immediate ban. Please anonymize cases and remove any patient-identifiable information. For health information arising from the United States, follow the [HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. No careers or homework questions:** Questions relating to medical school admissions, courses or exams should be asked elsewhere. Links to medical training subreddits and a compilation of careers and specialty threads are available on the [subreddit wiki](/r/medicine/wiki/index). Medical career advice may be asked only in the stickied biweekly careers thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "**9. No throwaway accounts:** Posts from user accounts less than one week old and/or with less than 10 comment karma are not allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**10. No memes or low-effort posts:** Memes, image links (including social media screenshots), images of text, or other low-effort posts or comments are not allowed. Videos require a text post or starter comment that summarizes the video and provides context.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we ask that medditors refrain from commenting on posts which are in violation of the rules above, and to follow general **[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).**\n",
      "\n",
      "Meddit has a tight spam filter and moderators may act with their judgement beyond the scope of these rules to maintain the quality of the subreddit. If your post doesn't show up shortly after posting, make sure that it meets our posting criteria. If it does, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmedicine) with a permalink to your post and explanation.

      "# Background and summary\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, at least 652,000 people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true number is suspected to be higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Healthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n",

This thread is a place to post updates, share information, and to ask questions. However, reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak. Major publications or developments may be submitted as separate posts to the main subreddit but our preference would be to keep everything accessible here.\\n\\nAfter feedback from the community and because this situation is developing rather quickly, we'll be hosting a new megathread nearly every day depending on developments/content, and so the latest thread will always be stickied and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one.\\n\\nFor reference, the previous megathreads are here: [#1 from January 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ets905/megathread_2019ncov_wuhan_coronavirus/), [#2 from February 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/f9jbqo/megathread_covid19_aka_2019ncov/), [#3 from March 2nd](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fccev7/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_2nd_2020/), [#4 from March 4th](https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/), [#5 from March 9th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ffulwq/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_9th_2020/), [#6 from March 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fgabx9/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_10th_2020/), [#7 from March 11th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fgusmo/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_11th_2020/), [#8 from March 12th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fhfz1p/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_12th_2020/), [#9 from March 13th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fhz33n/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_13th_2020/), [#10 from March 14th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fijfir/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_13th_2020/) (mislabeled!), [#11 from March 15th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fj0d5k/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_15th_2020/), [#12 from March 16th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjj0lr/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_16th_2020/), [#13 from March 17th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fk69en/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_17th_2020/), [#14 from March 18th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fkqf1p/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_18th_2020/), [#15 from March 19th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/flbw1a/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_19th_2020/), [#16 from March 21st](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fmb3os/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_21st22nd_2020/), [#17 from March 23rd](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fnjlod/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_23rd_2020/), and [#18 from March 24th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fo3wld/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_24th_2020/).\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nOn December 31st last year, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, most of which included patients who reported exposure to a large seafood market selling many species of live animals. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered. Despite unprecedented quarantine measures, this outbreak has become a global pandemic. As of time of writing, there is confirmed disease on all continents except for Antarctica, and many areas with self-sustaining human-to-human transmission. Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed. While it's a bit early to determine the ultimate consequences of the outbreak, it seems likely that most humans on Earth will eventually get this virus or will require a vaccine, and healthcare needs are enormous. The WHO has declared this a global pandemic and the world is hunkering down as public health measures, isolation, and social distancing take effect; hospitals around the globe are seeing their first or second waves of patients and are overwhelmed. PPE and respiratory support equipment is scarce.\\n\\n# Resources\\n\\n**Tracking/Maps/Modeling:**\\n\\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\\n\\n* [Healthmap](https://www.healthmap.org/covid-19/)\\n\\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\\n\\n* [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [University of Virginia](http://ncov.bii.virginia.edu/dashboard/)\\n\\n* [coronainfo.xyz](https://coronainfo.xyz/)\\n\\n* [BNO News](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\\n\\n* [Penn Hospital Impact Model](https://penn-chime.phl.io/)\\n\\n* [Basel Impact Model](https://neherlab.org/covid19/)\\n\\n**Journals**\\n\\n* [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/coronavirus-alert)\\n\\n**Resources from Organisational Bodies**\\n\\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\\n\\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\\n\\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\\n\\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\\n\\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\\n\\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\\n\\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\\n\\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\\n\\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\\n\\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\\n\\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\\n\\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\\n\\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\\n\\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\\n\\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\\n\\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\\n\\n**Relevant News Sites**\\n\\nThese sites provide free COVID-19 content.\\n\\n* [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest)\\n\\n* [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [Guardian Liveblogs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak)\\n\\n* [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/category/coronavirus-covid-19/)\\n\\n* [CIDRAP](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/)\\n\\n* [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [Stat News](https://www.statnews.com/tag/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/latest-news-updates/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-virus-everything-we-know-deadly-2019-ncov-wuhan-spread-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T)\\n\\n* [Ipsos Opinion Trackers](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/public-opinion-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic)\\n\\n# Reminders\\n\\nAll users are reminded about the subreddit rules on the sidebar.

       "   'selftext': '«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on \"how to be responsible on social media\", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what\\'s happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.\\n\\nStill, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of \"chilling\" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly \"emptied\", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).\\n\\nI still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let\\'s stop saying it\\'s a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can\\'t take it anymore. They don\\'t breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.\\n\\nThe course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can\\'t take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let\\'s face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.\\n\\nBecause that\\'s the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it\\'s not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.\\n\\nI can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have \"temporarily\" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.\\n\\nThe cases multiply, up to a rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I\\'m already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn\\'t know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask \"what can I do for you now?\" or \"leave that admission to me, i will take care of it.\" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.\\n\\nSocial life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I\\'m happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can\\'t go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don\\'t look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.\\n\\nTell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It\\'s our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I\\'m used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don\\'t spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we\\'re not even heroes these days. It\\'s our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone\\'s blood we don\\'t even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn\\'t matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy ».\\n\\n[source](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)',\n",

A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered. Despite unprecedented quarantine measures, this outbreak has become a global pandemic. As of time of writing, there is confirmed disease on all continents except for Antarctica, and several known and suspected areas with self-sustaining human-to-human transmission. Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed. While it's a bit early to determine the ultimate consequences of the outbreak, it seems likely that most humans on Earth will eventually get this virus or will require a vaccine, and healthcare needs will be enormous. The WHO has declared this a global pandemic and countries are reacting with fear.\\n\\n# Resources\\n\\n**Tracking/Maps:**\\n\\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\\n\\n* [Healthmap](https://www.healthmap.org/covid-19/)\\n\\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\\n\\n* [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [University of Virginia](http://ncov.bii.virginia.edu/dashboard/)\\n\\n* [coronainfo.xyz](https://coronainfo.xyz/)\\n\\n* [BNO News](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\\n\\n**Journals**\\n\\n* [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/coronavirus-alert)\\n\\n**Resources from Organisational Bodies**\\n\\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\\n\\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\\n\\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\\n\\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\\n\\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\\n\\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\\n\\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\\n\\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\\n\\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\\n\\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\\n\\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\\n\\n**Relevant News Sites**\\n\\n* [CIDRAP](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/)\\n\\n* [Stat News](https://www.statnews.com/tag/coronavirus/)\\n\\n# Reminders\\n\\nAll users are reminded about the subreddit rules on the sidebar.

       "\"#COVID-19 Megathread #12\\n\\nThis is a megathread to consolidate all of the ongoing posts about the COVID-19 outbreak. This thread is a place to post updates, share information, and to ask questions. However, reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak. Major publications or developments may be submitted as separate posts to the main subreddit but our preference would be to keep everything accessible here.\\n\\nAfter feedback from the community and because this situation is developing rather quickly, we'll be hosting a new megathread nearly every day depending on developments/content, and so the latest thread will always be stickied and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one.\\n\\nFor reference, the previous megathreads are here: [#1 from January 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ets905/megathread_2019ncov_wuhan_coronavirus/), [#2 from February 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/f9jbqo/megathread_covid19_aka_2019ncov/), [#3 from March 2nd](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fccev7/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_2nd_2020/), [#4 from March 4th](https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/), [#5 from March 9th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ffulwq/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_9th_2020/), [#6 from March 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fgabx9/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_10th_2020/), [#7 from March 11th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fgusmo/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_11th_2020/), [#8 from March 12th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fhfz1p/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_12th_2020/), [#9 from March 13th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fhz33n/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_13th_2020/), [#10 from March 14th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fijfir/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_13th_2020/) (mislabeled!), and [#11 from March 15th](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fj0d5k/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_15th_2020/).\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nOn December 31st last year, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, most of which included patients who reported exposure to a large seafood market selling many species of live animals. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered. Despite unprecedented quarantine measures, this outbreak has become a global pandemic. As of time of writing, there is confirmed disease on all continents except for Antarctica, and several known and suspected areas with self-sustaining human-to-human transmission. Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed. While it's a bit early to determine the ultimate consequences of the outbreak, it seems likely that most humans on Earth will eventually get this virus or will require a vaccine, and healthcare needs will be enormous. The WHO has declared this a global pandemic and countries are reacting with fear.\\n\\n# Resources\\n\\n**Tracking/Maps:**\\n\\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\\n\\n* [Healthmap](https://www.healthmap.org/covid-19/)\\n\\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\\n\\n* [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [University of Virginia](http://ncov.bii.virginia.edu/dashboard/)\\n\\n* [coronainfo.xyz](https://coronainfo.xyz/)\\n\\n* [BNO News](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\\n\\n**Journals**\\n\\n* [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus)\\n\\n* [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/coronavirus-alert)\\n\\n**Resources from Organisational Bodies**\\n\\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\\n\\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\\n\\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\\n\\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\\n\\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\\n\\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\\n\\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\\n\\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\\n\\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\\n\\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\\n\\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\\n\\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\\n\\n**Relevant News Sites**\\n\\n* [CIDRAP](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/)\\n\\n* [Stat News](https://www.statnews.com/tag/coronavirus/)\\n\\n# Reminders\\n\\nAll users are reminded about the subreddit rules on the sidebar.

A mainstay of our prehospital care of exacerbation of COPD is salbutamol/ipratropium bromide nebs. Obviously this is now a high risk procedure going forward, any recommendations in change of practice? PMDI use with spacers seems to be the logical decision for prehospital management however at this time our service is limited to salbutamol. \\n\\nAny other ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I built a website that allows people who want to volunteer/work to fight coronavirus connect with those that need help, be they hospitals, research labs, or even households. People sign up, and, in a couple of days, those that need volunteers can put in their location and we will provide them with a list of people nearby. Anyone in the US can sign up. If you are interested in helping, please volunteer, upvote or share. \\n\\nWebsite:  [https://endcovid.org/volunteers/](https://endcovid.org/volunteers/)\",\n",

       "   'body': 'So far the hospital has burned through over 70% of this years entire supply of masks in the last two weeks but we only have one confirmed case and two possibles that are still awaiting testing. My OR has decided to hoard all the N95 masks they could find or acquire, while also punishing people for wearing them while in the OR and attempting to prevent other units from stealing equipment. Anesthesia isn’t very happy with this as they aren’t comfortable working with patients doing even non aerosol generating procedures with the current level of equipment available. It’s business as usual until we get a local outbreak event but there’s a soft limit to adding non-emergent cases. Also several people have come back from cruises and or trips over the weekend but were tested. \\n\\nOne of our people who was working cases was tested on the cruise and shown negative but is back to work with what appears to be “allergies”.  Another who recently returned from Seattle was hanging out in the lounge even though they were off and was also displaying some “allergy” like symptoms. Preop is doing patient screening and visitor limits. Honestly I feel like we’re fucked because nobody is taking any of this seriously, the vast majority of my coworkers have either completely ignored what’s going on as propaganda or just downplayed this as another flu. I get we tend to have blinders on because draining fingers and C-sections are more important but I’m not very confident with how we are approaching things. Considering we live in a fairly large city with a large population of elderly or those considered at risk, when it does kick off we’re going to get slammed.',\n",

If you’re immunocompromised, your immune system has been suppressed or weakened whether through other preexisting conditions or through drugs like chemotherapy meds. Your body’s white blood cell count ends up lower than normal and you end up being vulnerable to more things whereas a healthy immune system could fight off the majority of things and limit the impact on your body. When you get sick, your body would send WBCs to fight the virus but with a low WBC count and weak immune system, your body cannot effectively fight off the virus, leading to a “worse course” as it infects more cells. It just means they’re at risk for worse outcomes with more moderate/severe symptoms compared to someone who has a healthy immune system. I hope this answers your question!',\n",

The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence **Sergio Romagnani** writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of [Vo \\'Euganeo](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/24/news/coronavirus_vo_euganeo_no_allo_stop_c_e_da_lavorare_la_lite_nella_chat_del_paese-249409885/) where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo \\'Euganeo highlight two very important information: \"the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease \".  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;For Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is \"trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. \" And again: \"It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo \\'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated \".  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;In Vo \\'- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.\\n\\nI assume [la Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/) is a reliable news source?

As a pretty common drug its widely available, and it seems that it would be good to take as a preventive treatment for COVID-19 for first responders and healthcare workers who might be exposed to a high viral load by the nature of their job, and, if the reports out of China, South Korea and Australia are right, it might mean a much more mild course of illness for first responders and healthcare workers who contract the illness. Its wide availability and low side effects in most people seem like its worth the risk, if it does work as suggested.\\n\\nWhat do you all think?',\n",

N95 masks have been recommended because they're known to filter particles as small as SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and preliminary reports of of China indicated that the virus *might* be able to aerosolize and be inhaled without filtration. However, since then, true widespread airborne transmission hasn't really been confirmed, and the consensus now seems to be that it mostly or only travels through respiratory droplets. *Surgical masks protect against droplets just as well as N95s*.\",\n",

They cancelled elective surgeries and had to increase capacity significantly to handle the surge. It sounds like they were extremely well-equipped to handle the situation, and it still continues to be difficult for them every day. Consider sharing it with your superiors or coworkers.

But here's a great well written link to a smart EM/Critical Care blog piece about the implications of messing around with vents which may serve your purposes.   He's coming at it from the idea of splitting a vent between two patients and what that would mean.  (This was actually done on the fly to help trauma patients survive the Las Vegas mass shooting event, which is very different medically as those are young patients not presumed to have lung disease or infectious illness who could be matched up by approx lung volume and had no unusual concerns about lung compliance or oxygenation).

       "   'body': 'Excellent, thank you. Key points from the summary:\\n\\n&gt; We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. \\n\\nMitigation works, but not well enough.\\n\\n&gt;Suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \\\\[...\\\\] will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. \\n\\nSuppression is of course optimal from a purely epidemiological perspective, but can we bear the costs of shutting down huge parts of our economy for an extended period of time?\\n\\nLooking forward to reading the full report when I have time, great find.',\n",

If this is true then SARS-2 will eventually become the 3rd human coronavirus that causes just the common cold in people.\\n\\nA highly recommended listen!',\n",

In the context of COVID-19.](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang)\\n\\n\"13 Mar 2020\\n\\nBased on initial reports from China, and subsequent evidence that arterial hypertension may be associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 infected subjects, hypotheses have been put forward to suggest a potential adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). It has been suggested, especially on social media sites, that these commonly used drugs may increase both the risk of infection and the severity of SARS-CoV2. The concern arises from the observation that, similar to the coronavirus causing SARS, the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs.\\xa0\\n\\nBecause of the social media-related amplification, patients taking these drugs for their high blood pressure and their doctors have become increasingly concerned, and, in some cases, have stopped taking their ACE-I or ARB medications.\\n\\nThis speculation about the safety of ACE-i or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scientific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is no data in humans.\\n\\nThe [Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)) wish to highlight **the lack of any evidence**supporting harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.\\n\\nThe Council on Hypertension **strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the Covid-19 infection.** \\n\\n*Prof. Giovanni de Simone,*\\n\\n*Chair, ESC Council on Hypertension*\\n\\n*On behalf of the Nucleus Members\"*',\n",

Realistically, we are not going to get the infection rate to 0 even if we shut everything down for a couple months.  Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.  The time where a total shutdown is needed is if we get into an Italy or Wuhan situation where the system is overrun.

Last night I asked if isolation patient and the response I got was “not yet”. Arrested at home after a couple days cheat pain. So I go to the code and the MD is fully PPE covered, mask and face shield. No one else is. I’m wondering- are ED physicians just wearing garb the whole shift?

       "   'body': '&gt; It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.\\n\\nThe numbers don\\'t really work, though.  There\\'s ~4,000 ICU beds in the UK and the average ventilator time for a Covid-19 patient is around two weeks.  So max they can treat is 8,000 a month or ~80,000 for the remainder of the year.  In a scenario where half the population is infected and 10% need ICU level care that\\'s 3.3 million patients.  So even a perfectly even spread using all available ICU beds, they can treat ~2.4% of the people that need it.  And that\\'s stopping care for everyone else that needs it.  They run around 80% capacity as is, so if we use excess capacity as the number that 2.4% drops to 0.5%.  \\n\\nIn a \"everyone gets infected\" scenario we\\'re all pretty fucked and a \"let\\'s get it over with\" plan is probably the best.',\n",

       "   'body': 'I think this is what they are going for as well.\\nI am extremely skeptical for multiple reasons. Firstly, the virus has proven itself extremely contagious. They are not currently doing anything to prevent its spread, and elderly people are not forced into self isolation. So...it\\'s spreading like wildfire right now through every age group. Personally I feel this will overwhelm the NHS within 2-3 weeks.\\n\\nThey\\'re also playing a dangerous game with trying to infect the \"healthy\" people as that will still come at a cost - 25 year olds still die of Covid-19. They are less likely to die, but doesn\\'t change the fact that they are certainly sacrificing lives for this \"herd immunity.\"\\n\\nI am also skeptical of herd immunity. Is there any evidence that you even develop immunity to this virus? There have been multiple reports of people who have been positive, then get better and are negative, becoming positive again.  Plus it seems that just like influenza it would be easy for a slightly different strain to come around and make though thousands to hundreds of thousands of people you let die for her immunity utterly pointless.\\n\\nAnother interesting thought I saw brought up is that since most other countries are going for the total lockdown eradication route, does this not mean they will have to stop all travel to and from the UK for the foreseeable future? Our current plan is let everyone get infected. If the plan continues for a year, which they think it will, surely that means any country that has stopped the virus via isolation would not allow someone from a country letting it run free come in.\\n\\nOverall, I see why they are trying to mitigate economic effects. I just can\\'t get behind the plan, and I do not see the NHS coping for very long.',\n",

       "   'body': 'I have been very intrigued by the seemingly slow UK response and the reasons behind it. \\n\\nHaving had a think, I think the reason may be about finding a compromise between the health and financial impacts of the pandemic: \\n\\nIf non vulnerable people contract the virus (20-50 year olds, no comorbidities) they are unlikely to need ICU admission. Therefore we are not v worried about them getting it. \\n\\nIn fact, we want them to get it at a steady rate so we can get them back to being fully fledged members of the economy: working, purchasing etc. They get the virus, they self-isolate for a period and then ideally behave normally. This will be facilitated by widespread rapid home-testing kits, production of which is being accelerated as we speak. \\n\\nMeanwhile we hide away the vulnerable (this group will be defined further in the next few days ie not just over 70s) as they are the ICU admission risk. They are locked away until the Ro drops below one due to the development of \"herd immunity\". \\n\\nI believe the economic risk is the reason for the aversion to a \"lockdown\" type strategy, not negligence.\\n\\nAny thoughts? Agreements/Disagreements?\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is necessarily the correct response but I think its what they are going for.',\n",

There is a TON of information out there that unless if you are incredibly sick, don't come in to the ED just to see if you have coronavirus.  Even if you have a known exposure, if your symptoms are mild, you are to call either the state hotline or the hotlines set up by the major health systems near me.  But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.  For one of them, my nurse basically asked them if they thought it was a good idea to come in and expose all of us if they did have it, or if they should just call the hotline like is recommended.  They basically said they didn't know if the hotline open during the middle of the night...\",\n",

       "   'body': 'When I used to counsel and people would bring these things up, I \\nwould encourage them to really do their own in depth research into it... really look into who is \"conducting\" the research and who is \"publishing\" the info- oftentimes it is the company themselves or a company they\\'re paying so there\\'s a financial incentive to make things look good- that line sometimes gets some people thinking. Bringing up the fact that there\\'s no one actually vetting the product and some studies have shown that many supplements dont actually contain the amount they claim on the bottle occasionally helps (not as much as you would think). Explaining that treatment plans are very tailored to the individual and these people dont actually set what\\'s going on with the pt or what they\\'re taking may interact/cause side effects with their meds or disease state may also rope some people.  Things that hit home are when you can relate the situation to something the patient can understand. One of my faves is, \"would you turn to an accountant (or your Aunt Jane) to give you advice on how to fix your car? No, so why take the chance with your body?\" In the case of Dr. Oz, \"how comfortable would you feel asking a heart surgeon to operate on your brain?\" (or something related to the patient\\'s field of work- \"Would you ask the guy who only does oil changes on passenger cars to fix your big rig?\").',\n",

       "   'body': 'Nurse who works at a psych crisis center (think psych-only ER) in the US. I’ve barely worked at the place a year but the more senior nurses have quit and I’m known as a smarty-pants who they will look to for guidance.\\n\\nFacility is a 23 hr institution so only day chairs for napping, no beds, communal bathrooms and showers. Barely any PPE. No true isolation rooms whatsoever. Patients are usually two to a room so the best we could do is keep 1 patient to a room at a time... but there’s only 8 rooms. Max capacity is 17 for the entire unit.\\n\\nWe get patients who are walk-ins, police drop-offs from the community, and referrals from hospitals. Leadership is struggling to find the right balance of staff safety, patient safety, and infection prevention. Our population and frequent flyers include a lot of older homeless people with chronic coughs. (Fuck.)\\n\\nI have suggested the following:\\n\\nPatients cleared by the hospital must present as afebrile and cough, if present, must be infrequent and the patient needs to be coherent enough to know to cover with his elbow and follow up with hand washing.\\n\\nPatients from the community (including police drop-offs) may enter through the back constables office where we have a separate shower. The patient will be checked for fever and cough; if cleared by nursing, the patient must immediately shower and change into our paper scrubs. Temperatures are checked twice each shift on EVERYONE.\\n\\nThe problem we run into is that our population is not always compliant. Already, we had a schizophrenic from home enter in a catatonic state whose arms/legs were rigid and we couldn’t change him into scrubs, let alone shower him. Then he tried to run out the door and needed a B52 so then we got to keep him, yay.\\n\\nThoughts? Advice? Help. What’s the safest I can keep my psych cuties and my co-workers?',\n",

Initially called a code and I cannot imagine if they were truly in cardiac arrest because it took 5+ minutes to get the bare minimum of PPE.

       "   'body': \"# Monday, March 16th\\n\\n*^I ^say ^let ^the ^world ^go ^to ^hell, ^but ^I ^should ^always ^have ^my ^tea.*\\n\\n* Josh Farkas, the wizard of PulmCrit, has written up a [nice new article](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/) examining the possibility of using one ventilators to support several patients. It's obviously not recommended practice and ideally things further upstream would prevent this necessity, but might be worth your time now so that you can muse over it before you're in the situation where you'd even be considering it. The short version is to use CMV pressure cycled mode; tidal volume isn't controllable but peak pressures are. Opiates may help suppress respiratory drive to prevent contagious tachypnoea if you can't set a trigger lockout. There's obviously a lot of deadspace issues and tracking tidal volumes in real time will be difficult.\\n\\n* The UK's RCoA, FICM, ICS, and AAGBI have partnered together to produce a [website full of resources](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/) and guidance. The [clinical guidance section](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/clinical-guidance) is worth bookmarking on your phone; this website is being continuously updated as further evidence and recommendations become available.\\n\\n* There's a nice visual representation of the history of pandemic from the World Economic Forum [here](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/a-visual-history-of-pandemics).\\n\\n* Globally, the number of infections and deaths outside of China has [overtaken](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655bc7db923ab22f97c5afa2c84c33cfdd1437a6/0_26_482_289/master/482.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fa66f7b0028ef967d550645abebd1dad) those inside China [for the first time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-global-deaths-and-infections-overtake-those-inside-china). The CDC has offered expanded guidance for the USA [recommending against gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html) of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks; even the Peace Corps is [withdrawing](https://www.peacecorps.gov/news/library/peace-corps-announces-suspension-volunteer-activities-evacuations-due-covid-19/) its volunteers. I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it's pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though [people](https://www.ft.com/content/4ee1bef8-652b-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5) [still](https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1239403796947755009) [find](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981#block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981) [a way](https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus)...\\n\\n* Staying on the topic of terrible ideas, [new airport screening measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/airports-coronavirus.html) were clearly not properly thought through, cramming thousands of travelers into confined spaces for extended durations:\\n\\n&gt; Wait times as long as seven hours at O’Hare on Saturday night came in the wake of a new policy toward travelers returning from European countries, who went essentially from zero screening on Friday to “enhanced screening.” “I found it a little ironic they had so many people waiting in the same area,” said Genevieve Couldwell, a doctoral student who lives in Salt Lake City and flew from London to New York on Sunday. “We went through this whole process only to be kept in a situation where there might have been more exposure.”\\n\\n* [Leaked documents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised) from Public Health England project a fairly bleak year for us:\\n\\n&gt;The document says that: “As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.”\\n\\n&gt;The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work “in essential services and critical infrastructure” will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”\\n\\n&gt; The document also states that:\\n\\n&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.\\n&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.\\n&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.\\n\\nThis isn't necessarily the most likely scenario, but it's rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.\\n\\n* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):\\n\\n&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.\\n\\n&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.\\n\\n* I think it's pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don't want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn't really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I've also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):\\n\\n&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.\\n\\n* Jack Ma, co-founder of China's enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s). Yes, things are bad enough in the USA, that poor, underdeveloped, and disadvantaged country that had absolutely no forewarning about an imminent pandemic ^/s, that Chinese philanthropists are donating vast quantities of relief supplies. *What has happened to America?*\\n\\n* We're hearing [confirmation](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-confirms-that-donald-trump-tried-to-buy-firm-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine/) from Germany that Trump tried to [buy exclusive American](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html) access to a vaccine; things got a bit heated and there seems to be more going on [under the surface](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal):\\n\\n&gt; Last week, the firm mysteriously announced that CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella had been replaced by Ingmar Hoerr, just weeks after Menichella met Trump, his vice-president Mike Pence and representatives of pharma companies in Washington.\\n\\nThe German interior crisis committee will be discussing this urgently today and we'll see what they have to say.\\n\\n* Baltimore has a great public health campaign about social distancing [here](https://twitter.com/AlecMacGillis/status/1239360166350532608). We need similarly impactful messaging globally ASAP.\\n\\n* Australia is [running short](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent) of PCR reagent just as it seems to be reaching an exponential inflection point:\\n\\n&gt; The Australian Medical Association has warned a common reagent that is critical in the testing of coronavirus is facing supply issues because of the huge demand on Australian laboratories due to Covid-19.\\n\\nSouth Australia has a small stockpile which may need to be carefully redistributed.\\n\\n* New York governor Andrew Cuomo has written an [opinion piece in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-trump.html) urging more drastic action, including use of active duty military personnel to aid in expanding hospital capacity - in echoes of what China did.\\n\\n* Leaving on a lighter note, here's a [message of hope](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1239383795205169152) from Arnold Schwarzenegger. I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.\\n\\n* And for those of you who have always wanted to see young, muscular rugby players washing their balls to help prevent COVID-19 spread (and who hasn't **always** wanted that?!), [you're in luck](https://twitter.com/KennyBania_/status/1239063570228232192).\",\n",

      "# Monday, March 16th*I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.** Josh Farkas, the wizard of PulmCrit, has written up a [nice new article](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/) examining the possibility of using one ventilators to support several patients. It's obviously not recommended practice and ideally things further upstream would prevent this necessity, but might be worth your time now so that you can muse over it before you're in the situation where you'd even be considering it. The short version is to use CMV pressure cycled mode; tidal volume isn't controllable but peak pressures are. Opiates may help suppress respiratory drive to prevent contagious tachypnoea if you can't set a trigger lockout. There's obviously a lot of deadspace issues and tracking tidal volumes in real time will be difficult.* The UK's RCoA, FICM, ICS, and AAGBI have partnered together to produce a [website full of resources](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/) and guidance. The [clinical guidance section](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/clinical-guidance) is worth bookmarking on your phone; this website is being continuously updated as further evidence and recommendations become available.* There's a nice visual representation of the history of pandemic from the World Economic Forum [here](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/a-visual-history-of-pandemics).* Globally, the number of infections and deaths outside of China has [overtaken](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655bc7db923ab22f97c5afa2c84c33cfdd1437a6/0_26_482_289/master/482.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fa66f7b0028ef967d550645abebd1dad) those inside China [for the first time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-global-deaths-and-infections-overtake-those-inside-china). The CDC has offered expanded guidance for the USA [recommending against gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html) of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks; even the Peace Corps is [withdrawing](https://www.peacecorps.gov/news/library/peace-corps-announces-suspension-volunteer-activities-evacuations-due-covid-19/) its volunteers. I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it's pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though [people](https://www.ft.com/content/4ee1bef8-652b-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5) [still](https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1239403796947755009) [find](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981#block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981) [a way](https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus)...* Staying on the topic of terrible ideas, [new airport screening measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/airports-coronavirus.html) were clearly not properly thought through, cramming thousands of travelers into confined spaces for extended durations:&gt; Wait times as long as seven hours at O’Hare on Saturday night came in the wake of a new policy toward travelers returning from European countries, who went essentially from zero screening on Friday to “enhanced screening.” “I found it a little ironic they had so many people waiting in the same area,” said Genevieve Couldwell, a doctoral student who lives in Salt Lake City and flew from London to New York on Sunday. “We went through this whole process only to be kept in a situation where there might have been more exposure.”* [Leaked documents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised) from Public Health England project a fairly bleak year for us:&gt;The document says that: “As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.”&gt;The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work “in essential services and critical infrastructure” will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”&gt; The document also states that:&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.This isn't necessarily the most likely scenario, but it's rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.* I think it's pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don't want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn't really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I've also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.* Jack Ma, co-founder of China's enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s). Yes, things are bad enough in the USA, that poor, underdeveloped, and disadvantaged country that had absolutely no forewarning about an imminent pandemic /s, that Chinese philanthropists are donating vast quantities of relief supplies. *What has happened to America?** We're hearing [confirmation](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-confirms-that-donald-trump-tried-to-buy-firm-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine/) from Germany that Trump tried to [buy exclusive American](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html) access to a vaccine; things got a bit heated and there seems to be more going on [under the surface](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal):&gt; Last week, the firm mysteriously announced that CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella had been replaced by Ingmar Hoerr, just weeks after Menichella met Trump, his vice-president Mike Pence and representatives of pharma companies in Washington.The German interior crisis committee will be discussing this urgently today and we'll see what they have to say.* Baltimore has a great public health campaign about social distancing [here](https://twitter.com/AlecMacGillis/status/1239360166350532608). We need similarly impactful messaging globally ASAP.* Australia is [running short](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent) of PCR reagent just as it seems to be reaching an exponential inflection point:&gt; The Australian Medical Association has warned a common reagent that is critical in the testing of coronavirus is facing supply issues because of the huge demand on Australian laboratories due to Covid-19.South Australia has a small stockpile which may need to be carefully redistributed.* New York governor Andrew Cuomo has written an [opinion piece in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-trump.html) urging more drastic action, including use of active duty military personnel to aid in expanding hospital capacity - in echoes of what China did.* Leaving on a lighter note, here's a [message of hope](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1239383795205169152) from Arnold Schwarzenegger. I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.* And for those of you who have always wanted to see young, muscular rugby players washing their balls to help prevent COVID-19 spread (and who hasn't **always** wanted that?!), [you're in luck](https://twitter.com/KennyBania_/status/1239063570228232192).\n"

       "'Hanging in there, thanks! Hope you are well. Main tank died, do we have any battle rez left? I concur. Elbow bumps from Stockholm, Sweden. Stay safe and take care! It\\'s been a week since this comment. So much has changed in that week that I want to ask, how are you doing? Are you hanging in there? Now it looks like the US is tanking :/ Doesn’t matter if you burst through the wall like the koolaid man to save a battered wife in a domestic violence incident, if you aren’t paying attention and she stabs you in the neck with a kitchen knife (which actually happens a whole lot. Violent dysfunctional couples are weird...) Absolutely agree on the feelings but that’s totally the point. Best life lesson I’ve learned in my (non medical) career is “if you feel the need to rush, slow down and back up”. It’s what saves you from mistakes, especially when stakes are high. And it’s easier when it’s constant, in a weird way. When you have one memorable event a week or day its easy to feel like you have to rush in and fix everything. When it’s a shitstorm when you show up and you know it’ll still be a shitstorm when you leave, you show up, put on your gear, and follow the damn procedures. As an ER medic in an almost no resource environment, thank you. [deleted] Those would definitely be very much needed for these patients. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is the feared complication of COVID-19, and needs specific parameters for ventilation. If you want numbers the protocol is called ARDS-NET. Yes, 100% oxygen would be a huge issue. The hospital oxygen sources I\\'ve seen are all flow restrictive as opposed to pressure regulators, so that wouldn\\'t work for this.  Plus you\\'d be ventilating your patients with 100% oxygen without a compressed air source, risking oxygen toxicity.Sorry typo: meant once per 4-6 seconds, not 4-6 times per second.  We had a call with a respiratory therapist yesterday evening who said being able to tweak the rate and limit the compression of the ambubag would be his primary concerns. No, most rooms in a hospital have an oxygen hookup. 4-6 times *a second?!* Where are you reading this?! Also PMing you my work email so I can respond quicker Thanks!    From what I\\'ve been able to gather, positive pressure/compressed air/medical air is generally only available in ORs, correct?  Another idea I\\'ve been looking into is trying to automate an ambu bag/bag valve mask.  I\\'ve got a prototype built where I cannibalized parts from our intermitting suction regulators to be able to drive a piston up and down to compress an ambubag in the 4-6 times per second range the internet says is standard.  What concerns might you have with this concept? ICU RN here, I just want to say thank you for this. I\\'m going to  share this with my co-workers and RN friends. What you said is so significant and profound; I have found some comfort in your words, thank you truly. Powerful reminder If you have questions after reading the link someone else provided, let me know. Would be happy to discuss with you. You could make \\'em last a bit longer by wearing a surgical mask over your N95... if you have them. No nebs.What are you guys doing with regards to intubation? Do you have PPE? they started it That\\'s what I was trying to say. Didn\\'t realize this would have started a whole chain of comments/arguments *(I was thinking of the annoucement headline from the Telegraph: \"Boris Johnson shutdowns UK\" - of course, that\\'s not technically correct either)*I\\'ll correct my comment. don\\'t encourage homicide unfortunately good information isn\\'t contagious I’d climb a mountain of bodies to make it to the polls this year, COVID virus or not. &gt;  Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union.They\\'re bluffing and we need to call their bluff. Things are only going to keep getting worse until ordinary people organise better and yes risk their jobs to stand up for better treatment.Also please vote... I\\'m not telling you who to vote for, just vote. You misunderstand. He\\'s not *reading* the book, he\\'s trying to *write* the book. I never said the argument for unions was anything but strong; I agree with you about that. My point is that you put your job in serious risk if you attempt to organize your workplace. If you don’t have a 100% perfect record with attendance, zero customer complaints, perfect reviews, etc., then you can 100% count on getting fired or finding your hours cut to 3 a week if you’re part time. And lots of employers aren’t above faking bad reviews or attendance records.  A general strike will only result in millions of terminations. Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union. That\\'s like asking someone how he knows what the weather is without being a meteorologist. Actually, it\\'s worse: it\\'s questioning how someone can know what a book says without being an expert, when all that is required is literacy. Right... so again you\\'re just making the argument for unions stronger.    Since the 1980s when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers there has been a continuous effort to reduce the power of unions and make them irrelevant chipping away at them bit by bit.  We need something like a general strike to get laws on unions changed. See all those people out there in the public with masks? Yuppers. And since we are low on PPE when we are out we go home.... Of course it’s illegal to fire someone for trying to organize. They’ll either find some other way to get rid of you (cutting hours, putting you on the graveyard shift, giving you an impossible workload that will inevitably lead to failure, transfer to their Alaska HQ, etc) or they’ll just fire you as an example to the other workers of what happens when you try to organize.  They’ll consider any fines to be money well spent, if it keeps a union out of their workplace.Edit:  they can and will fire as many people as possible to prevent organization.  If I means shutting down for a week while new workers are hired, so be it.  They’ll do anything and everything necessary to keep a union out, even if it means closing a location. Again this is why we need unions.  If enough people support a union they can\\'t fire everyone.  Anyway depending on which state of the USA it\\'s illegal for them to fire you for discussing a union with your colleagues. You need to be careful, though. In the USA your employer will usually fire you for even contemplating the concept of a union if they find out, if you’re not already covered by one. And if you *do* manage to organize your co-workers, they’ll just shut down your site, like Walmart did/does. ... at which point they will entirely un-ironically shout \"you should\\'ve warned us this would happen!\" Probably also \"you should\\'ve been more prepared!\"Well, you did, and you tried as best as they\\'d let you. I\\'m not sure about full recovery, but at least enough for a hospital to discharge them. Yeah you know this is exactly why unions exist and need to exist.  Support the unions in your industry! The mask is literally my only protection... 30mg is equivalent to about 650mg acetaminophen IIRC. But it\\'s better for pain as far as I know. mdi with spacer is the correct answer. This is horrifying. Thank you for the summary im just basing it off of stories of people being re-infected being very rare, despite the chances of you getting it twice is probably pretty high. If you think about how many tests have been taken, its likely that they weren\\'t all perfect, therefore the people who are allegedly getting it twice are probably just people who had inaccurate tests the first time or something like that. If you could get it again I reckon it would be common knowledge by now idk. Take all the data you see with a pinch of salt, this is the internet Please don\\'t re-write history here. China did not let WHO or other agencies come in until it was MUCH later. They blocked their own scientists and doctors from speaking up early on which led to the spread of this virus. They are not a shining example of anything. In addition, I\\'m not sure anyone believes that their numbers were as low as reported. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if it was actually in the millions. Do you really believe that not a single Chinese military member got infected? That being said, of course we will study this after the fact and find the best practices from each country. Let\\'s see how how we handle this surge in our ICU\\'s - and what effect the current restrictions have - before we judge ourselves as failures. Or is it anti retro viral use? And if we count in how many people are going to die as a consequence of that economic fallout, how many suicides, broken marriages etc...Both strategies have a bad ending and it is not clear which ending is worse. Hi all,Paramedic from Australia here.Just looking for some advice/ideas on the risks involved with prehospital management of infective exacerbation of COPD. A mainstay of our prehospital care of exacerbation of COPD is salbutamol/ipratropium bromide nebs. Obviously this is now a high risk procedure going forward, any recommendations in change of practice? PMDI use with spacers seems to be the logical decision for prehospital management however at this time our service is limited to salbutamol. Any other ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Stay safe out there! &gt; because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.Why would that be? The clinical significance and direction of the upregulated ACE2 is still ???. There\\'s mouse studies suggesting ACE2 is protective vs acute lung injury. Just want to clarify the 260k deaths is real bad but the real problem is the peak ICU demand 8x of surge capacity The us could accomplish many o the same things but had chosen not to  This will be a crazy case study with chapters upon chapters upon chapters on how we screwed up from not letting the WHO help US, not listening to medical professionals and experts, and just...its frustrating. Not to mention that the people’s mindset in the US vs countries like China are different. The US is more of a .....individualistic look out for myself type mindset?  I’m curious to see where this lockdown will lead Then they’ll just whine about PPE not being available when called on it.  Meanwhile, they don’t give a damn about their workers, and their lawyers can beat up your lawyers. Hi all!This is somewhat self-promotion, but it\\'s for a good cause and we need medical volunteers so I thought I\\'d post it anyway.  I built a website that allows people who want to volunteer/work to fight coronavirus connect with those that need help, be they hospitals, research labs, or even households. People sign up, and, in a couple of days, those that need volunteers can put in their location and we will provide them with a list of people nearby. Anyone in the US can sign up. If you are interested in helping, please volunteer, upvote or share. Website:  [https://endcovid.org/volunteers/](https://endcovid.org/volunteers/) I think we already realize that, while China\\'s response is impressive. We can\\'t replicate it, China is another beast. Most of the essential resources to implement their plan is already at their disposable or they are able to make them.I think it\\'s ironic that the things that make us describe China as a dystopia. Are things that helped them control the outbreaks. From their Extensive Mass Surveillance System, being the factory\\'s of the world, asia\\'s collective culture in general, to the gov complete authority over the people.They built a hospital in 7 days, were able to manufacture whatever they need from PPE to Ventilators, according to the WHO\\'s mission CT scan is done in 10 mins.CCP realized what needs to be done and had the power and resources to do it.I hate to admit it but we have to acknowledge China\\'s points of strength.And I hope that we learn from their strength in the future.However, I think that we should look into Singapore and South Korea\\'s Response.Both are Democracies who are successful in limiting the spread. I also think that it\\'s likely that China will have a second wave but it will be ready for it or maybe be able to prevent it till a vaccine is available. This comment brought the scene in saving Private Ryan to my mind, where they are Omaha and talking about leaving people to move onto someone you can actually save. I\\'m curious about everyone\\'s thoughts on the information surrounding avoiding ibuprofen. I\\'m getting questions from patients and the only reputable mention of it I\\'ve found is in this Lancet article, which only briefly mentions it in the setting of potentially increasing ACE2: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltextI\\'m hesitant to base recommendations on laboratory studies but ....? Toradol hasn’t been shown to be a great antipyretic After briefly getting tests back in 3 days, we\\'re back out to 5+ days and we\\'ve been told to cut access to testing to only health care workers and people in the hospital. Sounds like there\\'s a shortage on reagents to me reading between the lines of some things said to me. You\\'re being downvoted, but you are technically correct.This is the quote from above&gt;  the UK has shutdown yesterday.The technically correct quote should be&gt; the UK has start to shutdown yesterday Assuming country x somehow prevent infection spread completely. As most ppl stays at home with limited contact to others for more than 14 days ( while 80% of the infected develop Immunity and 20% are treated ).Won\\'t that stop the spread till a case is imported or infection reemerge, repeating the same circle.Just to be clear I\\'m not criticizing any measures taken to minimize the death toll. Hmm, no. Looks like they are afraid it might cause too much fear. &amp;#x200B;Anyway, it shows about 40 or so patients in large rooms with only 1 staff in sight. Patients desaturating, patients semi-unconscious on NRB, patients almost falling out of gourneys. It is one of the saddest things I have seen. &amp;#x200B;Anyway point was quality of care appears to have really taken a hit with the staffing issues. A year from now, I think we\\'re going to look back at China and realize they were a special case.Because of China\\'s authoritarian rule, they had the ability (and even the political will-power) to enforce stick lockdowns and ensure this passed relatively quickly.Western countries will not see the same lockdown response. I\\'d personally expect this to pan out for a lot longer time in western countries. Supposedly they can be reused up to 5 times with the limit being obvious contamination (wet with moisture from ones own breath or body fluid splash), which ever comes first.With the supply chain issues I guess there is no alternative And special needs students who not only aren\\'t getting school but aren\\'t getting PT, OT, or speech therapist. I have a 3 year old in school who has been doing phenomenally since she started and I\\'m worried that all of her gains will be lost. We can afford to bring people into our house to do it privately for a little while but I\\'m not even sure that\\'s a good idea. Slow down the system. Stop new infections Has there been any case report of COVID-19 in HIV patients ?I think it may Provide insight on the role of immune response and the cytokine storm theory. Let’s put it this way, as a general rule people and animals will develop immunity to a virus after being infected with it. This is how most viruses work, in particular it’s also how most coronaviruses work. There really is no evidence that this virus is an exception to that rule, and if it was then it would make this virus exceptionally unique. A few anecdotal reports that could easily be explained by a flare up or prolonged infection shouldn’t cause us to toss everything we know about viruses out the window. The bigger concern is that there is some evidence of people being contagious after symptoms have subsided. I am far more worried about people who had the virus spreading it to others after their symptoms are gone than the possibility of this virus being an enigma that causes reinfection. Slow it so the system can handle it. China almost certainly hasn\\'t eliminated it. Word I\\'m not sure if my question make sense, When a country shut down, is their goal to slow down the infection to a spread the health system can accommodate. Or are they aiming for China, elimination of the infection till a vaccine is made ? Based on the fact that almost every virus works like that and there really is no evidence that this virus is an exception. Shot by someone who didn\\'t? Good bot Is nonfunctional ppe even considered ppe at that point? Why the devil would you shave... what madness was this? So far the hospital has burned through over 70% of this years entire supply of masks in the last two weeks but we only have one confirmed case and two possibles that are still awaiting testing. My OR has decided to hoard all the N95 masks they could find or acquire, while also punishing people for wearing them while in the OR and attempting to prevent other units from stealing equipment. Anesthesia isn’t very happy with this as they aren’t comfortable working with patients doing even non aerosol generating procedures with the current level of equipment available. It’s business as usual until we get a local outbreak event but there’s a soft limit to adding non-emergent cases. Also several people have come back from cruises and or trips over the weekend but were tested. One of our people who was working cases was tested on the cruise and shown negative but is back to work with what appears to be “allergies”.  Another who recently returned from Seattle was hanging out in the lounge even though they were off and was also displaying some “allergy” like symptoms. Preop is doing patient screening and visitor limits. Honestly I feel like we’re fucked because nobody is taking any of this seriously, the vast majority of my coworkers have either completely ignored what’s going on as propaganda or just downplayed this as another flu. I get we tend to have blinders on because draining fingers and C-sections are more important but I’m not very confident with how we are approaching things. Considering we live in a fairly large city with a large population of elderly or those considered at risk, when it does kick off we’re going to get slammed. Unfortunately that isn’t an option &gt;  I think you do get immune to itBased on what facts are you saying this? I\\'m not arguing with you, but I\\'m reading so much anecdotal data... That\\'s not really helping. I\\'m not an expert but there are very few reports of reinfection, most of them seem to be anecdotal or a result of inaccurate testing before. I believe in herd immunity. Makes more sense than in China, where they\\'re just gonna get rid of quarantines just for everyone to get re-infected No! The whole point of this post is to *minimize* exposure! In the US &gt; I assume la Repubblica is a reliable news source? Yeah, no reason to think this would be faked by the paper/journalist. Hopefully there\\'ll be real analysis on this soon. Thank you. I fully understand all of the above already. I was merely clarifying for the sake of avoiding misinformation that the uk has not shut down yesterday, as stated before. Thank you for all of your information regardless. Like I said, the process has started and is being phased in over the next days/week. So far they have removed emergency personnel from large gatherings, which makes them impossible to insure and therefore impossible to hold. Recommendations on social distancing have been implemented. Right now attending restaurants, clubs, shopping centres is not recommended but not enforced - they want people to comply willingly. But once the UK\\'s caseload reaches the appropriate number, compliance will be enforced. I said the UK hasn’t been shut down yesterday, because it hasn’t. Restaurants, clubs, schools, transport, shopping centres and everything still open. I don’t understand how this constitutes shutting down. Do you know of another source for this video, it\\'s blocked now Yes it has. We were initially following a mitigation strategy, but following a recent report from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College London we\\'ve switched to a suppression strategy (i.e. close it all down). That\\'s not happening instantly, it\\'s being phased in over days. I know that in the hospital I work at (CA) the adult side has run out of swabs and we\\'re dangerously low on reagent. Not that we have any test kits anyways so the swabs were sent to Quest and are just sitting there... If test numbers are being obscured with for that reason, do you think retroactively accurate numbers are likely to emerge once the economy has stabilized?  Or never? No it hasn’t?? first step will be 24h and then continue for a regular shift - so 32h. but i expect to go back to weekend shifts, i.e. 48h, our *regular* workload means i usually get to sleep 4-6h/shift. Yes but I\\'m still unclear, is there an emergency during a pandemic? Can anyone point me to some references regarding immunity after COVID-19? My country has decided to go with the group immunity strategy and frankly I feel a bit anxious; I was under the impression it is not clear at all how immunity works with this virus? The UK has walked back the \"herd immunity\" thing - claiming it was misinterpreted by the media. In any case, the UK has shutdown yesterday. I want so much to direct some nursing colleagues here. I’m afraid, based on their social media, that they would “brigade.” I cause enough trouble without calling in the “it’s just a flu” nurses. Stand by it! My stupid ass sister has  been partying it up in NOLA. I won’t see her until his is ALL over. She can’t be trusted. Period. Symptoms of viral infections(not all) are due to body\\'s immunological response. Glucocorticoids are used in treatment of symptoms of viral infections, f.ex. hemorrhaging fevers. Children have a weaker immune system then adults and they not affected.So in theory to temporarily moderate immunological response in severely affected patients could mild but prolong the symptoms. Any professionals have an analysis about what is going on in Japan? It seems like we are running the same “herd immunity” strategy as the UK. I know this may be their strategy to flatten the curve in hopes the Olympics start on schedule but it’s causing people to get restless and ready to get back to normal since the daily numbers are so low. Testing though is low it seems. If I ever build a house I’ll have an attached garage with a laundry room with a shower stall between the house and garage. Or a shower in the garage. Watch these become HGTV features. They’ll call them “Physician Passthroughs” or something. This is not a bad idea. Broken hips and hot spots out to sea. Plus, aren’t there supplies in these ships that could be used? Surely they’re not using “just in time” inventorying. Drop Kick Murphy is live streaming their audience free St Pats show. Please encourage everyone to stay home and watch that ALONE. Your coworkers should be ashamed. And publicly shamed. Ive seen too many nurses saying really stupid shit! Including four nurses and a nursing student that stayed in NOLA until the cops came around to close up shop! It’s gonna be real bad real soon. Also important to note, as the UK report states, China\\'s draconian measures only work so long as they are enforced. As soon as the restrictions are lifted, the virus will resume it\\'s growth.Wuhan will have slightly lower transmission rates since some now have immunity, but I believe the number of recovered cases is still very low relative to the city\\'s population, so it likely won\\'t have much of an effect. There are laws to report whistleblowers. I am not familiar enough to say if they protect you for going to the media or just to a regulatory body. I am not currently working and would be happy to research that for you tomorrow if you drop me a PM with your state. That policy is bullshit, unfortunately Are you a med pro!? Can you get off reddit and contribute to the pandemic plz? &amp;#x200B;The detachment is unreal. There are already 2 US ER docs in critical care. Well get updated numbers tomorrow. That’s been the pattern in IL as far as I can tell. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent&gt; The department of health said there was currently significant pressure on stocks of all consumables used by laboratories.But it voiced particular concern about RNA extraction.“Due to global demand exceeding supply, stocks of all laboratory related testing consumables are under considerable strain,” a spokeswoman said.“At the moment there are particular concerns around supplies of swabs and DNA extraction kits.”https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-chief-warns-of-supply-pressure-on-reagents-for-coronavirus-tests/573999/&gt; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Wednesday told a House appropriations subcommittee that the agency is “aware of pressure in the supply system on the reagents” needed to run diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus. Specifically, Hahn said “there are pressures particularly around RNA” required for COVID-19 testing. Got me ;-) No parties around anymore due to friggin corona... so I gotta tell Reddit ;-) Stay safe! Removed due to Rule 4 After you had exposure to COVID19 without PPE. Also called quarantine. So... Dont\\' drive faster than Mach 1? ;) Pretty sure if the mask is not your primary protection, you can use anything that is porous to air as a facemask even a tissue paper.  Just be sure to secure tightly so you don\\'t touch your face while in use.  And then follow proper procedure for sanitizing your hands before taking off and disposal. Keep turning those knobs buddy /salute We can only test: people who have been overseas in the last 14 days and have cough or fever; healthcare workers with fever; severe bilateral pneumonia. We are massively under testing. Neither of the two positive cases in my city met testing criteria and both have no idea where they got it. This comment simply doesn’t apply to the situation we’re heading into The stock market is tanking anyways.  It knows whats up.  The US incompetent lack of testing means tracing is a completely useless strategy to mitigate now.  We must assume everyone has it and the sombering study from the UK says that even with maximum measures, the need for ICU\\'s will far exceed our surge capacity by several factors.Here\\'s hoping that chloroquine or one of the other promising drugs is available en mass to mitigate the effects especially the lung fibrosis that\\'s requiring so many infected to be hospitalized. gf-gsw Something you can write on, thought to have originated from Egyptian papyrus I think there are many reagent manufacturers over Europe. I don\\'t know what I would do but by clearing of based on symptoms/clinical examination one does create spreaders sooner or later. Priority 4, give them morph,  get them into the shade and have their mate hold their hand and talk with them. Once you stabilise Pri 3\\'s, go back and check your 4 to try to evac them. The mind is often our worst enemy. This is simplified as best I could. If you’re immunocompromised, your immune system has been suppressed or weakened whether through other preexisting conditions or through drugs like chemotherapy meds. Your body’s white blood cell count ends up lower than normal and you end up being vulnerable to more things whereas a healthy immune system could fight off the majority of things and limit the impact on your body. When you get sick, your body would send WBCs to fight the virus but with a low WBC count and weak immune system, your body cannot effectively fight off the virus, leading to a “worse course” as it infects more cells. It just means they’re at risk for worse outcomes with more moderate/severe symptoms compared to someone who has a healthy immune system. I hope this answers your question! Chicago according to their comment history. LEEEROYYYYYY    JENKINNNNNNNS To everyone working in a medical laboratory: is your lab or country having problems with obtaining reagents for DNA extraction? We (South Korea) recently had to beg Roche to please send more reagents because the PCR testing volume went through the ceiling. I understand this 100% but this is a nationwide problem and completely out of my hands. We are an island. Apparently the test reagent is made in Italy? They’re keeping it for themselves so we’ve been told. Could mushrooms contain the cure to this virus?\"Antiviral compounds isolated from the mushrooms have shown potential activity against prominent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, etc.\" ? C [removed] Agreed. I had ERT (emergency response team) training before, and we learned triage for mass casualty situations. It was a tough lesson, but our goal is to maximize how many people come out of it alive. If someone is near death, you actually declare that person deceased. You do not spend time trying to save that person until after the triage is done. Normally, for non-disaster situations, the goal is to save that one person, buying time for the paramedics to arrive [this video](https://www.cottagehealth.org/covid-19-video/)  has some good info. I believe later on in this presentation it shows the accuracy.  Having a broch is the most accurate followed by sputum..... My city is likely about to get hit hard. I\\'m a little scared, but I\\'m ready as I\\'ll ever be.If I die I\\'m going to haunt all of the CMOs. Engineers and fire signs (Sagittarians, Leos, Aries). I know this comes not really helpful from an academic tertiary center, but fight for tests at every cost. Clincal presentation and symptoms are neither specific nor sensitive. We\\'ve seen positives in asymptomatic contact persons or just a mere sore throat. Majority of inital presentations afebrile. Data is powered by PowerBI, here a link: http://aka.ms/covidreportI don\\'t have ICU numbers for US, [here](https://i.imgur.com/KVoY56R.png) is what I have You\\'re not wrong, and I guess I should\\'ve stated that the patient in my example was just contact precaution, not droplet, airborne, or contact + droplet. If they had coronavirus it would be very different. It\\'s a matter of understanding how the disease that requires them to be isolated is transmitted when making these decisions. The point is that even that event was an emergency if there wasn’t a risk of infection and you weren’t being hit with a pandemic.   In the middle of everything, that is kind of a selfish thing to do...sure you get to feel like you saved that patient (because you obviously did) but at the expense of many others and the safety of yourself and coworkers. RN here. Don’t go back early. Rest. Heal. And love on your new baby. My daughter is 7 months old. I am not doing anything to risk her health. I am not doing anything to risk my health and leave her without a mom. If you get sick you think the hospital will care about you? You think they’ll remember you in a few months? Screw all that. I’ll do my job. If the hospital does not have enough PPE I’m not going in the patients room. I am not risking my life for anyones except my child’s. Is it after they seem to fully revover in some cases? Hit it with a UV sterilizer or ozone machine. &gt; Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China. And so onRemoved under rule 2/3 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. As a universal healer in any game I play, I want to just say its people like you who give me that glimmer of decency and help me continue to play. Thank you friend. Am I dumb or why do people keep saying immunosuppression is a risk for worse course? Does tylenol not have same upregulation of receptor? [removed] As a paramedic, thank you. This is what first contact emergency health workers need to learn to do. Slow down, don, proper PPE prior today Pt contact. Also Doff PPE correctly as well. This post might literally be a lifesaver. Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene  than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China.Due to the shortage of masks for which should be better used for doctors ?Or because the masks helps little to prevent for the virus yet hands hygiene helps a lot? This question confuses me a lot as I saw few people wearing masks in videos or pictures.I would appreciate so much if anyone could tell me where I can find the answer. Really? I thought they lowered the standards because of low supply when in fact N95 is preferred/recommended. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-15/amid-protective-gear-shortages-healthcare-workers-risk-becoming-part-of-the-problem Maybe reach out to the Department of Health (state or federal) and see if they have needs. Go ahead and collect the recovered case counts from the various public health websites yourself and show me that it’s 7,000. Until then, I’ll go with the agglomeration websites, which by and large have been remarkably consistent. Yeah but they mostly say severe ones like cancer/transplants/heart disease/diabetes etc. I couldn’t see any specifics for autoimmune conditions. It\\'s obscene that people are being expected to deduct isolation time from paid time off. Especially medical professionals. Incredibly disgusting.Not that it\\'s a new problem or anything. But you\\'d think that now of all times... So, an agglomeration site, not a public health organisation of any sort. Yeah, no. Don’t most news sources say that older folks and people with health complications/are immunocompromised are at higher risk? Not only that, but he didn\\'t know that it had happened and immediately asked a random staff member of he did it. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#recovered [deleted] This.

May your family get through this quickly and with good health.  Good luck. Taiwan is right next to China and got 20 currently sick and 47 that got better. Both of your countries did not fire top pandemic staff because they gave mpre than average pushpack from cutting budgets to build a monumentally stupid wall. Donald Trump and his followers needs to own every single, avoidable  bad case of this disease I don\\'t disagree but looking through their history this sub isn\\'t one they typically post in and the comment didn\\'t include anything new so I thought it would be useful to recommend searching the sub before posting as they clearly hadn\\'t seen it discussed here despite it coming up quite often over the past few weeks. I just feel like it’s not taken seriously as if I had a serious illness etc. I’m trying to find anything that states autoimmune conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis) actually put me in a higher risk :( Listen to me. If you are autoimmune and you can self isolate - Do it. Regardless of your profession, you cannot help anyone - in any capacity - if you are infected, on a vent, or dead. You are in the category that is at a statistically higher chance of complications + death. Just my .02 cents thinking too many negative thoughts. alone, imagining healthcare bankruptcy it’ll happen Yea I feel you.  Have my baby sleeping on me now  and I’m  kinda freaked out about what the next several months will be like. It’s a little Is this your first?  I’m glad this is #2 for us because with the first one I had no clue what I was doing (sometimes still feel that way).Good luck to you both. Seems like the use of N95s is overzealous in both examples.

The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence **Sergio Romagnani** writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of [Vo \\'Euganeo](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/24/news/coronavirus_vo_euganeo_no_allo_stop_c_e_da_lavorare_la_lite_nella_chat_del_paese-249409885/) where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.  &gt;  &gt;The immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo \\'Euganeo highlight two very important information: \"the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease \".  &gt;  &gt;For Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is \"trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. \" And again: \"It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo \\'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated \".  &gt;  &gt;In Vo \\'- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.I assume [la Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/) is a reliable news source?

Is this the temporary firebreak type vaccine? Worrying about what to do about work, I have autoimmune issues and immune health conditions plus allergies and weak immune system on corticosteroids. I will receive full pay to self isolate but I just can’t fathom doing so or that my bosses will be at all happy about this.Just because they aren’t extremely serious health conditions I feel like I’m in a grey area. I can’t really find much info about autoimmune conditions and covid, can anyone point me to some info? It’s the third rule from House of God - in a cardiac code, the first procedure is to take your own pulse. That doesn\\'t track with any reputable reports ice seen so far. Can you provide a source? According to today\\'s WHO situation report, there\\'s a total of 167511 total confirmed cases world wide. Your number would mean that half of all the people that have been confirmed infected have recovered, which simply isn\\'t plausible given the recent hikes in numbers. In most places, tests are only being reported positive/added into the totals once confirmed. I.e. my institution had 2 confirmed inpatient, 8 at home, plus another 50 or so PUIs. State only reports a hundred total cases or so. But there are obviously way more than just my hospital in the state Who issued the restriction? If it came through the executive branch of government, then the police non emergency line. If it came from public health authorities, they should have a telephone number, and will probably take interest in physicians who are ignoring notices. A few months of missed school is mostly just fine. It could be a hassle for kids going into their last year of school and exams, but we can do things like delay exams. Even defer a school year entirely. These are social constructs not fixed in stone.Parent sanity is another thing entirely... but I guess I have to cope. No nation\\'s economy will bounce back from a wave of mass deaths and panic either. Leaders cannot ignore this and hope it will go away. I wish they\\'d see that \"the economy\" exists as part of and for society, it is not an isolated virtual entity that can be considered in isolation from workers/consumers/producers/infrastructure/transport mechanisms as human beings. Better to have a longer period of measured disruption with lots of compensatory and supportive measures like government funded sick leave minimums, limited access small class childcare for critical workers, even temporarily introduce basic income. But no.Social and mental health impacts concern me too. I\\'ve been home with a 6yo and 3yo almost all the time since Friday. 6yo has a cough, probably nothing but better be cautious and protect others. Plus it\\'s our small way to slow the spread and buy time. But OMG it\\'s frustrating. We\\'ll need to start getting out more once eldest is better, doing limited and cautious social contact a bit. Balance risk with sanity and kids mental health too. (layperson peeking out from lurking, hope it\\'s ok deep in the child comments).CPAP was invented for hospital respiratory support before its later deployment in home sleep aponea treatment, right? My son was on CPAP+O2 for a couple of days after a difficult birth.I know CPAP is not a substitute for a proper ventilator. Even bilevel CPAP doesn\\'t deliver negative pressure for forced exhalation, and it\\'s an open system so there\\'s all the risk of spraying potentially infectious droplets everywhere.But I\\'m curious about the extent to which consumer CPAP could be hacked to help, possibly in combination with mechanical exhalation support (bands, etc), outflow filtering, etc. Even basic devices have exhalation pressure relief now and bilevel is much more common.I found the recently posted article on the Las Vegas shootings fascinating (and very sad) too, especially using one ventilator for multiple patients by multiplying volume and using Y tubing. Crazy but awesome.I have two MD friends (both ex-ER, one ex-general-surgeon, both now GPs) who have been expressing frustration at the lack of visibility of any efforts being made to plan for these sorts of \"better than nothing\" emergency measures. They don\\'t Reddit so I figured I would ask. I strongly advocate for all facial hair. Anyone who worked with that nurse needs to be quarantined.  Else congratulations on starting a new cluster.

Their sentiment towards everyone else?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roNlgIY9QKw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roNlgIY9QKw) This is really wonderful, good 4 you. I’m just replying so I can copy paste and share this. I also work in healthcare. It’s important everyone stay safe. Our staff is invaluable. Saw a comment here from a PA about a nurse hoarding N95 to swab a patient. PA wanted an n95, nurse shrugged them off. PA got pissed, went to find charge nurse and nurse suddenly \\'\\'found\\'\\' the box in the drawer. I think the bigger issue there was the hoarding, but the provider wanted an n95 for swabbing.&amp;#x200B;Currently a new thread about patient treatment prior to result of swab. Nurse describes Droplet PPE (not including hair/eye pro)[https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjv7le/the\\\\_magic\\\\_swab\\\\_test/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjv7le/the_magic_swab_test/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I’m worried that it’s reducing effectiveness of social distancing. People see only 20 or so cases in our decently sized city and think nbd, but I can’t imagine we have fewer than hundreds to thousands of cases at this point. Is there any significant differences between N95 for HCW and N95 for other work? still always good to bring it up again as new information has been cropping up daily.that being said, it’s being used but still experimental and i am eager for more information as well. \"Hey everybody, I\\'m a Redditor who has no experience at all with medical care, but I think I know more than a professional so I will try and shit on them for karma.\"in before the edit:\"edit:   Guys, why the downvotes?  I\\'m just trying to save lives?\" My trust is telling us that even if correct PPE hasn’t been worn to not self-isolate unless we get symptoms. We’re currently looking after confirmed COVID-19 patient along with others. But it will upset stockholders! pictures of similar types of examples for those rusty on their oropharynx physical exam would be useful. With what do you decon yours, please? That\\'s a legitimate fear, but more people are going to die if you do nothing. You can always ask the newspaper to remain anonymous. Please call and tell the newspaper what\\'s happening. Lives are at stake. Sounds risky and should only be a last resort if PPE runs out. Not familiar with that product.  Are you saying it will filter a virus? &gt; Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now.There have been radiologists that work remotely and have hospitals outsource to them for years. Can anyone who’s been seeing cases of COVID-19 give a more detailed description of signs and symptoms?  Specifically I’m interested in the appearance of the oropharynx. Is it very erythematous? Papular erythema? Tonsillitis? Petechiae? I’m a GP working in Australia where we’re rapidly running out of test kits and we’re very restricted on who we can test. When there was an Ebola outbreak and the volunteer doctors sometimes got infected I thought, \"How does Ebola get through their hazmat suits?\"  Then I learned that the dangerous time was when doctors took that stuff off after a long shift - they\\'ve been working long hours in the African heat, they\\'re thirsty, they need the toilet, their faces are dripping sweat and they can\\'t wipe them... If the outside of the Hazmat suit wasn\\'t properly disinfected with a spray, the doctor could easily come into contact with all the infectious fluids on the outside of the suit which had come from their patients (and as Ebola causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding, there could be a lot of these). Not making sure the outside of the suits was thoroughly disinfected was a matter of life and death for these doctors. I have profound admiration for all of the healthcare workers who volunteered their services to work in such unpleasant and distressing circumstances, to try to stop it spreading any further. Don\\'t understand why people are saying a year+ disruption to life.China got their outbreak under control almost completely in a month and a half. They now have a manageable influx of cases that can likely be controlled with good surveillance and precaution among healthcare professionals. Life will largely be able to go back to normal in Wuhan soon.There\\'s a false dichotomy here. People will not be able to go back to life where we weren\\'t taking basic COVID precautions like staying home if you were sick, washing your hands, etc., until a vaccine is available, but social distancing CAN more or less end if we commit HARD, right now, before the spread is overwhelming. Dithering at this moment commits us to \"let\\'s get it over with\" and hundreds of thousands - millions of dead. Yet our hospital just changed their quarantine policy to only quarantine if you are symptomatic and no longer quarantine for suspected exposure. What a bunch of clowns. This is my understanding.  What were the qualms expressed in the comments? I think virus negative on PCR I love you. Thank you for your sanity, patience, and effort. It’s very helpful. I’m an old retired person who used to have a medical license, but I am the resource person for maybe 100 real (not virtual) people. Would you post your link to animal rescue again? People can be asymptomatic and be shedding large amounts of the virus. All patients with suspected contact with the virus should be tested and self isolated as per the WHO since current screening is ineffective. However, with the testing issues in the US, this may not be feasible. Ugh. Rest in peace, doctor Xia. Probably change in case counts over a few days. When the increase in cases starts to go down, it\\'s getting under control. Nurse here:What are the recommended precautions for these patients?I was under the impression it\\'s droplet + eye/hair protection. Airborne precautions in case of aerosolizing procedures (intubation, bronchoscopy). It is also my understanding that after the procedure they are back to droplet.&amp;#x200B;Is this true?Ive seen two posts/comments with complaints about PPE even though the PPE listed seemed appropriate I’m still trying to figure out how the self quarantined person ended up with a gsw. Where are you? My hypothesis is keeping the economy from collapsing.&amp;#x200B;Any worse news and stocks will dive another 10+%. Emotional times in the market. There\\'s about 80,000 recovered individuals right now. If you get sent to isolation today, who will pop that in tomorrow?That\\'s the point. You being healthy and uninfected will contribute to saving many many more people than you saving 1 infected person today and then being stuck at home for weeks.It\\'s not business as usual, it\\'s a pandemic. You\\'re going to lose people and it\\'s going to fucking suck. But society can\\'t afford to lose you and your expertise. Who do we report them to? I know for a fact that my hospital had more positive tests today than is being reported in the news for the state. I don\\'t really know what the disconnect is. It is found in feces, respiratory secretions and blood per [this report](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-covid-19-may-spread-several-different-ways). &amp;#x200B;There\\'s even evidence to suggest a fecal oral transmission. Icu Rn here. I feel absolute gross having to reuse my n95 Thanks This has been covered extensively for weeks, search the subreddit if you want more information.https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fbfj0r/covid19_prophylaxis_in_healthcare_workers/ Yeah, especially the Facebook post doesn\\'t sound remotely close to what I\\'d consider mild. Milder than a bad case of the flu, maybe, but that\\'s a maybe. I am debating going against the policy they set via email which is, essentially, “work unless you’re displaying symptoms.” I think any of us who came into contact with this nurse should self isolate but that would be a lot of people so I can see why they don’t want that. I agree. The clinic recently instituted a policy of essentially “work unless you have symptoms of COVID” which, given the literature, doesn’t sit right with me. Yeah, we have plenty of droplet precaution masks and gloves in clinic, but not enough N95s and to be used in highly suspicious cases of covid only. I\\'ve been told we have goggles, just don\\'t know where. Definitely makes me nervous because we\\'ll probably start having Healthcare workers get sick as we get more cases, and that will create a much more difficult situation. Same goes for us in funeral service. Oh my bad. Please report them if you can. Same thing happened to me. Had to fight tooth and nail with my family to get them to stay put. Was successful but saw a lot of friends who I had personally talked to going out to bars. Lost a lot of respect for some folks, don\\'t know if I can ever look at them the same again. Rule 2 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. You’re the exact person this is meant for.....smh Good Evening,I had a thought after watching these two videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7F1cnWup9M&amp;t=2s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE4_LsftNKM&amp;t=4sIt seems like hydroxychloroquine is being used in China, South Korea and now Australia (where they are calling it a cure) to treat COVID-19. As a pretty common drug its widely available, and it seems that it would be good to take as a preventive treatment for COVID-19 for first responders and healthcare workers who might be exposed to a high viral load by the nature of their job, and, if the reports out of China, South Korea and Australia are right, it might mean a much more mild course of illness for first responders and healthcare workers who contract the illness. Its wide availability and low side effects in most people seem like its worth the risk, if it does work as suggested.What do you all think? I\\'m in a similar position as an RN with a 5 week old (that was 5 weeks premature and spent 3 weeks in the nicu). If they need me back early I\\'m going to go back most likely. My husband is not happy but we need my income and it\\'s just part of the job. It\\'s not an easy decision with a newborn. If I\\'m dead but I\\'m #1 in dps that\\'s a win in my book. Thread I had with an Infectious Disease doctor on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ffulwq/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_9th_2020/fk12m2l/?context=10000 &gt; Slow is smooth and smooth is ~~quick~~ fast.But yes, absolutely. One of my favorites. What is PAPR (insert PnR meme)? China put a draconian but highly effective quarantine into place. South Korea managed to surge test people, and quarantine any positives efficiently. Without similar measures, it just won\\'t happen. It\\'s very real. Even 100m sprinters are taught to take their time. Don\\'t rush it. My postop lung transplx patient coughed her T-piece off and desatted to 80% in a few seconds. I ran in and popped it on and it was a full minute before her o2 sats stabilized. You\\'re totally right, we should be careful what determines an emergency, but in the ICU it is very situational. These patients are on and off all kinds of support, and they lack any reservoir. A single bad event can be critical to their stability in some of these sickest of pts. Generally speaking, you\\'re right. Most events dont require true urgency. But there are places and times where we need to move. That\\'s what happens when your healthcare system gets overrun. Patients that might make it with intensive care die, because you don\\'t have the intensive care capacity for the number of cases. [removed] Exactly.  The way your outbreak was discovered was mind blowing to me.  A researcher who went against the government to test for covid in her flu study discovers community spread...WTF.  Supposedly, we have such a critical shortage of masks and other protective equipment in CO that they’re going to shut down testing unless they figure out how to get more.  Geniuses. I’m not sure on if they can force her or not. It’s kind of a moot point with my wife. She isn’t going to say no if they ask her to come back early.  She  is close with everyone there and her being gone means everyone else has to work even harder. We are lucky because we will be able to get help from family and I have a very flexible job. Layperson here.  I have zero connection to healthcare, aside from being a patient more often than I\\'d like.  I\\'ve been reading these threads on r/medicine for the last 3-4 weeks; it\\'s my primary source of information, and I feel like it\\'s helped me stay ahead of this thing and take proper actions for myself.  I try to pass pieces of it along to those I care about. I have a 65y/o mother with diabetes, hypertension, and on long-term immunotherapy for CLL who refuses to stay home.  Given the PPE shortages and inexcusable failures of our government at all levels to establish ANY kind of plan to mitigate disaster, I also come here for sobering reminders in cold clinical language that affirm my outwardly healthy, vibrant, awesome mom is likely going to die a totally preventable death that I could see from a mile away and was entirely powerless to stop. I love you, medical professionals.  I hate you, healthcare system.  I respect you, science. Business people should also then understand that forcing staff to work without PPE exposes them to being sued for negligence and workers compensation claims.  Not to mention whistle blowers going to the media, in the current climate how do you think a hospital forcing people to work without PPE is going to go with the public? I find this so confusing because the virus seems to have tapered off somewhat quickly in China and South Korea. Should I shave my beard? [deleted] The situation in Italy is bad. &amp;#x200B;Check out the video. Patients unmonitored. Some gorked needing tubed. Mortality not surprising. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\\\_continue=1&amp;v=U6yeSQr1VGk&amp;feature=emb\\\\_title&amp;fbclid=IwAR2\\\\_RW4RD8IYdwvP31hnOjmUCXbtG5e0ux66taAlHOT41SOjgYeVm\\\\_MKfGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=U6yeSQr1VGk&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;fbclid=IwAR2_RW4RD8IYdwvP31hnOjmUCXbtG5e0ux66taAlHOT41SOjgYeVm_MKfGk) If you have confirmed direct contact with a COVID positive patient, you should not see patients.  You are contagious prior to symptom onset. Avg symptom onset is 5-7 days from exposure but can be up to 14 days. Not having symptoms is not reliable indicator. Non-urban, Wisconsin (so some people are probably wayyyyy out of the loop here). Treat non-covid pt\\'s on the boat.  Leave hospitals for the infected. I was so heartened by this effort before I read the page and realized they don’t know what a ventilator is. 14 day self quarantine until enough tests become available. Inability to test is absolutely handcuffing care. That is so tough. I couldn’t imagine having to go back to work so soon after having a baby. Especially to a to that kind of work during this time. Assuming she used FMLA, can they force her to go back before 12 weeks? I love these. I feel like I\\'m a time traveler from the future who has discovered your diary. Please keep going! Can someone comment on how accurate our PCRs are? Should I trust a negative? or is each lab a little different? It doesn\\'t matter. The US apparently only had 1% of the N95 masks on-hand required for an event like this. The hoarders are annoying, but they aren\\'t the problem. Poor planning is. No the phrase is in english, not korean, so dedpite bad grammar i kept it I would talk to your supervisor and explain that you have what you think is close exposure and ask what to do. They might want you to get tested? But that would mean you would have to have access to tests and be out until the results come back. Clearly they have WAY more infections that they don\\'t know about.But the number of deaths and ICU cases for a country that size is terrifying. I would be wearing a properly fitting N95 respirator and gloves at a minimum. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching anything like your phone, keys and wallet. Be very aware of what you touch with your hands and use alcohol wipes on your personal items. Stay safe. Right. Translated instead of interpreted to make it sound mystical. And what about steroid allergy nose sprays like fluticasone? I didnt cuz its not a proverb. Its the catch phrase of koreans jr drs association. They found no virus in blood, urine, or feces (other than viral rna).  I’d love to know if it’s in breast milk. [deleted] In the POTUS &amp; Co address today, they mentioned they\\'re working in the upcoming bill to allow N95 masks/cartridges to be supplied by companies who supplied N95 masks to industry (I\\'m assuming this is mostly opening up product lines). Their claim is this would open up a significant amount of domestic production capacity for hospital use. I took this being there is a lot of production capacity for OSHA approved N95 masks which aren\\'t certified for health care use. Check this team out! They\\'re looking at 3D printing ventilators. [Project Open Air](https://www.projectopenair.org/) Thank you. I love the way the data is displayed-is there a link to access these graphs daily?Also, is there a way to view ICU bed usage within the US? That would tell us how close we are to crashing into the iceberg in the States.. Think about the logistics - you\\'d have to cram a bunch of possibly contagious people on a boat to get them to the ship in the first place, then you\\'d be shipping them to a box crammed with people. I\\'ve never served on one, but those boats are probably better suited for disaster relief than contagion. Fair enough, thanks! That\\'s basically where I\\'m at as well. absolutely I haven’t looked at the primary data and honestly have no business commenting. Thanks for thinking of us. We have, at least, convinced leadership to cancel all live shows and most food service at the casino. Sanitation has been doubled. I just know it won\\'t be enough. I also know where we will all be without casino profits. It\\'s a tough spot to be in. Your prayers have been answered, kind stranger.  We NIPPV\\'d the (figurative) shit out of the toilet.  The ghost of my face has been banished. For now. It’s the nurse who sits next to me who was coughing last week who tested positive. I last saw her on Wednesday and I haven’t taken a test and dont have symptoms. I actually just spent an entire hour talking to my doc about this situation and he\\'s frustrated because the people in power aren\\'t making smart choices. And again, we\\'re in Seattle, and his network\\'s team isn\\'t making smart choices. No, that patient was from the SCJ cult while the salt spraying church is nominally mainstream. Well mainstream by Korean standards given that they performed faith healing and were doing so on the day of the salt spraying. Nearly 8% mortality?

Seems a little overly antagonistic now given that my main use of reddit is moderating but, well... sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes he eats you.I would jump at temporary housing. I am slightly worried for my own health but would be devastated if I brought something dangerous home to my family. Was it you or the other nurse who tested positive. Hipster vegans Thanks for the update, I’ve been wondering how different Tribes have been preparing for this. I really hope that you’re able to convince tribal leadership, it sounds like everyone is in a really difficult spot. I haven\\'t been on social in several days because I\\'ve spent every waking hour trying to convince my tribal leadership to take this seriously. No one outside of health care is listening to me because they don\\'t want to close the casino. THIS IS NOT GREED- our tribe is not part of IHS and gaming funds our health care (and everything else). The bill before congress only expands Medicaid and IHS funding. We are on our own. I am exhausted and we haven\\'t even been hit yet.  Though, if we were testing I know of several cases that would likely be positive. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. Plungers are like BIPAP. The key is getting a good seal. Oh good, we\\'re running out of surgical masks (and we have 0 confirmed cases, and are doing extraordinarily few tests) so we\\'re expected to reuse those/put them in a bag. I raised the same point as above - any particles on the outside will get on the inside - and was then told it only applies to the nurses (I\\'m a resident). I was like...that\\'s not any better, the same is still true for them, but haven\\'t gotten a response yet. Unfortunately, that\\'s a totally different skill and equipment set than what we\\'re set up for (capital equipment like ventilators, etc) :( Not just economic. Think about all of the children who aren\\'t in school learning. Also the emotional/psychological toll of extreme social distancing. Ours are being canceled starting tomorrow. True, someone recently characterized a mild COVID19 case as \"the worst cold you will ever have in your life and live through it.\"Having had bacterial pneumonia before and currently working with COVID19 patients, I hope I will be one of those asymptomatic cases, since the bacterial pneumonia experience was already bad enough. Right, that\\'s what I\\'m saying it\\'s not \\'mild symptoms\\' that\\'s pretty severe. It\\'s super shitty. At the end of the day, protect your family. Get your wife to ensure that her employer has facilities for them to wash coming to &amp; from work. Your wife should ALWAYS ensure that she wears her PPE. Also when leaving for the day she should change her clothes and wash thoroughly. Put the clothes into a plastic bag and either leave them sealed outside or wash them immediately upon returning home. Do what you can to protect yourself. And even more importantly, do everyhting in your power to protect the residents of her home. You guys need to practice social isolation more than anyone. If there\\'s a single case in that LTC facility, there\\'s a high likelihood of multiple fatalities. It\\'s an hypothesis at this point AFAICT:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext So no ketorolac either in your opinion? The direct care nurse gave me shift report too. She wasn\\'t wearing PPE for duration of care because she had no reason to. Management should have sent her home immediately but we are short staffed already. People arent taking it seriously enough.... Does anyone have any knowledge about ACE2 upregulation with any NSAID\\'s besides ibuprofen? I\\'m specifically looking at ketorolac. It would be nice to have a non-opioid for muscle/joint pain that isn\\'t going to increase susceptibility to infection by COVID (if that in fact happens with ibuprofen at all, which is just a hypothesis for now). I don\\'t have much time to do a deep dive at the moment, so anything would help.This is referring to the Lancet article linked below:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext I’ve been posting all over worried about my fathers PPE but now a nurse that I sit next to had a bad cough last week. She tested positive for the virus over the weekend. They want me to come in anyway since no symptoms but I feel very concerned after seeing reports of transmission pre-symptoms. I do not want to transfer this to my patients who are primarily acute and elderly. Should I stay home? I am thinking primarily of this article that was shared here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1Does the evidence seem compelling enough to people that I should self isolate or would PPE be enough to abate most concerns of accidentally infecting those I come into contact with?FWIW I’m at an outpatient clinic this week. They showed a study on that at last week\\'s grand rounds.  From SARs-1, but surgical masks were non inferior.  Still, for aerosol inducing procedures (bronch, intubation), I\\'d definitely want an N95 Unfortunately we’re one of the bigger pediatric hospitals in the US. I’m too afraid to lose my job otherwise I would. to be fair, pneumonia does that to you. Even if you dont have ARDS, the weakness will be with you for some time. Slow is smooth and smooth is quick. I figured it would be old news, I just had to check. Are you in a major city? Have you thought about going to local news, as well? If the news reports that local hospitals are not equipped, I (hope) more people will take their quarantines seriously and it might lessen the load 10-12 days from now. Q: How can you tell if there\\'s a jet pilot at a party?A: Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll tell you. Can I rephrase then?Are we close to having an antibody test? Because I’m wondering if, given the very low reinfection rates, once healthcare workers (such as myself) get COVID-19 can we test for/establish immunity? Maybe rent a furnished studio for her? Will be cheaper than a hotel at least What’s the best case scenario? You feel better for a few hours but follow the same general disease trajectory.What’s the worst case? You increase viral uptake and have a more severe disease course.I’ll stick with Tylenol, thanks. Plus..... you guys need tanks at the ready... You know just in case. Our hospital systems’ leadership cancelled elective surgeries today (our state coronavirus rate was at 26 at the time of the announcement), which surprised and impressed me. Also. Plowing money into buying ventilators and equipment is not going to magically train the army of specialists required to use them. Hell even the cleaning staff are specially trained in our intensive care ward. We\\'ve been told we may have to improvise masks out of vaccine bags. This situation really has shown up massive shortcomings in both funding and the planning. There\\'s for sure a lot of variables here that are very hard to predict. I hope your government would step in with some kind of social safety net in that case, I doubt that scenario would happen here in Sweden. thats insane man :( Are they considering that if we keep everything shut down like this for more than a month or so, a bunch of lower income service workers are going to be out on the streets, since they won\\'t be able to make rent? Social distancing isn\\'t going to happen in the homeless camps and breadlines that spring up. I do worry that if we do too much social distancing, it\\'s going to bite us in the ass. Hospitals are already reusing disposable N95\\'s...so...reusable is actually a plus here. Just showed up to work today. An elective surgical patient with bilat pnuemonia exposed ~25 healthcare workers and is being tested for it now.  Essentially an entire floor of staff along with Anesthesia and RT. I don\\'t understand why elective surgeries aren\\'t being canceled. Ours is having us wear a surgical mask over the N95 to keep droplets from contaminating the front of the mask, so it can be more safely reused. Luckily we aren\\'t running out of surgical masks yet. I saw posts on one of these mega threads about HCW avoiding exposing their family. The general consensus was HCW should wear scrubs that the hospital launders, or have a designated \"dirty\" room at home. When you get home, you strip in the \"dirty\" room, wash your clothes and take a shower before coming into contact with the rest of the family.It\\'s not...great. But it\\'s better than nothing? You can also tip it to propublica: https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/we-want-to-talk-to-people-working-or-living-on-the-front-lines-of-coronavirus-help-us-report We were told not to come in. If we were sick enough to wear a mask at work we\\'d be sent home. Occurrences for call outs and needing to burn through your pto (fuck you if you\\'re low on that for any reason) to take this time off still apply. Maybe they are symptoms of zinc supplementation catching on? Today situation in Italy[link Italy 3/16](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vhulmcbii5rnao/Microsoft%20Power%20BI.pdf?dl=0) Yellow - ICURed - DeathsOrange - RecoveredPlease spread the message to stay at home; it is for our safety. Do it before it becomes bad as it is here in Italy right now PGY2 Neurosurgery Resident I second mask and other standard PPE. Our hospital is low on N95\\'s and has no Papr hoods, for those who need them. If you can\\'t get the raw materials needed for those, even simple stuff like surgical masks, gowns, and gloves are in limited supplies. I know it\\'s not necessarily the most exciting engineering challenge, but it\\'s really what\\'s needed. PPE, vents need people to operate them This is what truly sucks for our situation. We have one bathroom and no garage, wife is an NP caring for an entire LTC home of 100+ patients. I can\\'t think of any way to maintain good protection for me and the kids in this situation. We\\'ve been talking about putting her up in a hotel but how the hell can we afford that for months? Your fist job is to fly that damn plane, your second job is to navigate it around safely (cause you can\\'t navigate anywhere if you\\'re a ground dart), your third job is to communicate. No one cares if you managed to follow proper protocols with ATC if your plane dug a hole. Did you see this hackathon for creating an open-source ventilator? Some interesting comments at the bottom too [https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/](https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/) I believe so. I cannot find the article but they believe most providers who get sick do so by infecting themselves accidentally while donning/doffing PPE Wow, what state are you in? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5.pdf Totally agree.  At the very least, temporary housing for exposed staff should be made available so that healthcare workers have the option to isolate themselves if they feel it necessary.  Maybe the stockpiles don’t exist. That could be.  Then maybe we need to consider dedicating facilities to Covid 19 patients.  Rapid 4 hour testing prior to admission would make this possible in large urban communities.There are so many ways this terrible situation could be addressed without throwing millions of healthcare workers into a gunfight to do battle with butter knives. They are aware. Revenue seems to be more important at this point. It’s sad. &gt;With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.For what\\'s it\\'s worth, I\\'ve seen some evidence that surgical masks are just about as effective as N95 masks for protection. N95 masks have been recommended because they\\'re known to filter particles as small as SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and preliminary reports of of China indicated that the virus *might* be able to aerosolize and be inhaled without filtration. However, since then, true widespread airborne transmission hasn\\'t really been confirmed, and the consensus now seems to be that it mostly or only travels through respiratory droplets. *Surgical masks protect against droplets just as well as N95s*. It may be more reasonable to use home health services for other non-COVID cases as the respiratory compensation requiring intubation seems to be rather rapid. I agree that it needs to happen now - and that is why I explained how it will happen and when it will happen. The hospitals with higher levels of emergency preparedness are really shining right now and I feel horrible for everyone else. You shouldn\\'t be in this position. Someone shared this with me here yesterday, [head of dept of anesthesia and ICU in a research hospital in Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKS1pahoPRU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=412) talking about his experience right now. They cancelled elective surgeries and had to increase capacity significantly to handle the surge. It sounds like they were extremely well-equipped to handle the situation, and it still continues to be difficult for them every day. Consider sharing it with your superiors or coworkers. I assume Italy\\'s recommendations should not be taken lightly. He is such a fucking bastard. Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. it\\'s respiratory.  PPE more important.  Should wash hands too [BBC also just reported that Alibaba co-founder is shipping supplies to us.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51904379) Unfortunately, much of this is not being reported in local news, maybe to limit panic? ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ It would lose  (⌐■_■) the element of supplies Maybe masks and other PPE? “No you’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”“All right then.”Favorite movie of all time. I empathize with your situation.  We’re sleeping in separate beds also.  At the very least, if hospitals are not providing proper PPE they should make temporary housing available for staff do they can reduce the chance of transmitting to their community.  This is what happened in China, correct?At a certain point, it does become a question of ethics, and I can see where you are coming from. At the same time, critical care RNs exposed to infectious patients for hours on end without proper PPE strikes me as dumb, counterproductive, and ethically wrong.   I’m the asshole in this ethical situation, and I know the subtext is that people don’t get care.  And yet if we look at italy, that’s the exact situation their healthcare providers are in.  So I don’t know what the answer is, except the situation is incredibly disturbing and I think we need to vocalize it so that the public is aware of what is happening. I totally agree that PPE should be made available to staff. Staff should be protected as well as be able to reduce spread between patients. It seems fucking obvious to me that cost should not be a factor, and if stockpiles exist, they should be distributed as required. My understanding is that, in many cases, there actually aren\\'t stockpiles, and that ordering through the usual pathways is not helpful. What we shouldn\\'t do is just abandon people in their hour of greatest need and close hospitals. Safest bet, if you have a mild to moderate case just take paracetamol(acetaminofen) to control your temperature.

Probably unrelated but reminds me of my work as airline pilot: We never rush, take our time. If not available, we make time. ESPECIALLY when shit hits the fan. My local hardware store still has a few half face respirators and filter kits available - P100. They are much more expensive ($40 for the respirator plus $20 per filter kit), but  being overlooked.Obviously, actually being able to use in the work place is a different story.---EDIT: I should clarify, this late Saturday night. Madness may have hit in the last day and changed this. As of late Saturday, masks where nearly wiped out but still a few respirators available. I\\'ve had a respirator for a while and wear it when I apply stains/finishes to woodwork. Most people don\\'t seem to have an interest in $60+ of safety. Studies like this should help determine the length of time of isolation. Get a Google voice number [removed] Anyone know why the WHO\\'s sitreps have now shown 2 consecutive days since a confirmed case in the US when that obviously isn\\'t the case? Have we stopped reporting to the WHO or is this just oversight? NSAIDs: yay or nay? Lessons from China about proper PPE from Xihong Lin, a professor at the Harvard Department of Biostatistics (see slides 55-56).  The protocol in China is a protective suit, medical goggles, cap, face shield, mask, and gloves when seeing suspected COVID cases.  Using this level of protection, none of the 42,000 external doctors and nurses sent to Wuhan was infected, though some of the internal doctors were, before adequate PPE was used.https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tGJF9tdv4osPhY1-fswLcSlWZJ9zx45/edit I remember reading about mRNA vaccines a few years ago in an immunology text book, it was a relatively recent book, but they made it sound like these were a long way away.  I guess this is as good an opportunity as any to give it a try as we are in dire need of a vaccine and not having to wait for incubation would be huge.  Don\\'t believe there are any other mRNA vaccines on the market. I\\'m not sure where you are but it hasn\\'t hit us hard here in Canada yet. My girlfriend is also an ICU nurse. In the cardiovascular ICU which means that their unit is already setup with vent\\'s and all the required equipment, one of the only ones in our city. They\\'re not rushing everyone to renew their fit-tests and pretty much spending every shift doing more and more training. It\\'s super stressful for us as she\\'s 1 week into return to work after 12-months away with our baby. We\\'ve also had to setup pretty much a decontamination zone in the garage. She will change out of scrubs when leaving the hospital and will go into the garage and straight to the downstairs shower to scrub down. We\\'ll be scrubbing that bathroom and the garage down on a daily basis.

[deleted] Dunno.Found this if interestedhttps://sci-hub.tw/https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243 Our hospital wants us to store our N95 masks in a bag with our name on it and reuse for multiple cycles. Seems counterproductive. If the mask is actually catching particles, aren\\'t we just going to cross contaminate ourselves by putting on and off multiple times? Someone gold this Australia here, ran out of masks, using Bunnings p2 mask as first line specialist. The world has gone crazy. Odd mechanism. Are there any other vaccines that work through host translation of mRNA? We have an algorithm but it’s... not perfect. Because a huge chunk of what we spend on \"Healthcare\" isn\\'t spent on healthcare. It\\'s spent on administration, like our corrupt insurance \"industry\", hospital billing, chargebacks, medical loans (how insane is that??) etc. any evidence to debunk or verify claim?Whats the official verdict.

(I had two 24h shifts last week and after that I need sleep or I am a danger to my patients) Basically they don’t stockpile enough of this stuff for something like this. They typically order it when they need it and it shows up. Now everyone everywhere needs the same stuff at the same time - globally. Patients will need largely the same interventions provided by a small group of specialized healthcare providers. So we have a supply/demand issue there too. Similarly our hospitals are tailored to meet the demand they normally experience, but add corona virus on top of what has already been a bad flu season and you have a lot of sick people coming through the door.This is why it is important to flatten the curve. We can’t stop the virus but we can slow down the growth rate so that our healthcare system doesn’t get overwhelmed as badly. The good news is that the people who are in our healthcare system - every tech, nurse, pa, and doctor I know are intelligent, hardworking, and brave people. They are working hard to get prepared and they will do their best to help us all through this. Fuck. No way governments will go with that timeline (18 months in paper). They will pick an acceptable mortality over the economic hit that would cause. person\\\\* not just american First rule of Heavy Weapons Guy: protect the medic.

Kaiser Permanente Washington Vaccine trial: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04283461?term=mrna-1273&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 Yesterday I had to order an emerg CT on a SDH which my attending needed to decide on whether to operate as an emergency at night or the next day. It took 6h to get it because they have to clean out the CTs after every suspected covid. And my attending made me call and ask to please hurry with it two times (I apologized obv). And this is only the start, one CT is already designated only covids. We have no face shields, N-95, or PAPR on the unit we designated our COVID unit. They are only with the house supervisor at all times. I can only hope it changes but I don’t know it it will. Our pharmacist is vital to the RRT/code team. I just grabbed the code box of meds and told mine to stay out because of lack of equipment. It’s hard to shout in N-95 and through doors to get their expertise Medical device engineer, here. Say I have a US-based factory and team of engineers available. Is there anything we could be doing to help? We\\'re tossing around ideas like \"Design and build crude emergency ventilators\", but it seems like anything we could do would take too long (even ignoring the regulatory considerations).Are there any needs for equipment that aren\\'t being met? hi, do you have any source on that? (my gf has asthma and I keep trying to find any data on it) Yes, I’m not sure what the timeline on getting the end products...and in the meantime we’re just flying blind in the healthcare system. Whether it’s 16 days or 6 weeks, we’re talking about exponential growth of an infectious disease and we’re in an even worse position than China and Italy because we’re not the only healthcare system in crisis.  I know people don’t want to hear this and that’s why it’s not being reported as it should be.  It scares me just thinking about it. All sketchy data, but it seems to come on late, even after respiratory recovery. Also sketchy reports but in Italy they have supposedly been using echo to decide who to give vents to (avoiding those with newly diminished EF). People are talking about getting back to normal in a few weeks right now on the radio (NPR).I don\\'t know, at some point we are going to have to decide what social distancing to maintain long term and what not to. I don\\'t think we can keep schools closed for 18 months. You are so correct and honestly I’m a dumb ass when it comes to doing anything to help. I blame comics. It was a place I never thought I’d be and feel rattled by it. I absolutely did not risk myself without proper PPE and kicked out those who didn’t. We didn’t even have it on the unit or near this unstable individual. It was also a poor execution of transport. Our policy is to place a blanket of intubated patients and close doors. Our COVID unit is 2 elevators and 3 hallways away from ICU   and probably 1/4 mile total. We are out of PPE in a major midwest urban US hospital. Even surgical masks are under lock and key and are not being distributed outside ER/MICU. Patients still need to be seen in my clinic. We have canceled every appointment we can, and are able to re-route symptomatic patients to a dedicated COVID testing suite so we are lucky in that sense, but I still feel my odds of exposure are 100%. We know the infectious risk peaks right before/at the initiation of symptoms. I don\\'t think I can (or will) ethically refuse to see patients who are very ill and on active treatment. I am thinking of at least starting to sleep on the couch to try to isolate myself from my family. This whole comment chain is a much needed window of fun in a pretty grim time. Thank you.

It requires a cell number confirmation too Imperial College has released their modeling of different mitigation/suppression strategies for this epidemic.

Feel free to try and use it but don\\'t necessarily expect a swift answer. make a throwaway email and twitter handle whilst using a VPN. No one will know who you are. &gt; I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required.&gt; healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should.With as much as we spend on healthcare in the US, how the hell is it this bad?! One million US deaths in the best case scenario which seems to include 18 months of social distancing? Can you imagine what the world would be like a year from now? I can’t comprehend it. Apparently China forced manufacturers of other goods to start manufacturing PPE and hand sanitizer. A friend mind is from China and her extended family offered to send her a bunch of masks and hand sanitizer. We\\'re in Seattle, so she was like, \"Hmmmm...\" She\\'s MS though so she can work from home, so they\\'re all pretty safe and security. You absolutely have to post before/after pics! We need something lighthearted. I don\\'t see this the same as taking 30 seconds to throw on PPE.        Using \"due care\" as reasoning to be this reserved does not justify driving in a manner such as this all the time. There needs to be a balance and driving to emergencies is completely fluid based on severity of offense, other motorists, road conditions, etc.       Experience is the better teacher and if an experienced cop were to always be this reserved, they should additionally be prepared to have their actions highly scrutinized by the public and civilly litigated when it results it people dying.         I get where you\\'re coming from but when there is an in-progress violent offense, or mass casualty event taking place, some of these recommendations for driving go straight out the window. Except PPE... where that crap. Damn, my asthma means every cold kicks my ass for 9 days. I just read this from NPR about how N95s are difficult to make, the manufacturers are running above 110% capacity and they are repurposing other factories to produce them ...https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-mak Eh I have asthma and that\\'s pretty much what happens when I get a any old cold. And no paperwork. Nurses are pally tanks, have to tank and heal. surgeons are resto priests Meanwhile, I\\'m not even sure Trump is fluent in English... EUROPE - please, for the love of God, if you are a HCW of any sort and even though Europe is a hotspot for covid-19 and you still decide to go on trips to other countries especially and spend time with your friends, stay home for 14 days as the gov ordered few days ago. [this article ](https://www.cas.sk/clanok/958343/lekar-z-kramarov-ma-koronavirus-sokujuce-slova-kolegovej-manzelky-toto-vas-uplne-odrovna/) (article is in Slovak language) informs about a doctor from a major hospital in the capital city of Slovakia, who took a vacation in Austria, socialized with his friends, came back to Slovakia and did not stay home (mandatory 14 days or you get a fine) and went to work as usual, did surgeries, saw patients, worked in the ED and such and of course then he started coughing a lot and tested positive for covid-19. This resulted in quarantine for additional 27 HCW. So irresponsible. ### Removed under Rule 2:No personal health situations.

[removed] Seriously, they need to be taking this more seriously and start acting with a sense of urgency. What’s your institutions policy on staff working with URTI or LRTI symptoms? It seems to me that we can’t sustain having everyone off for mostly other viral cases, but that there is a fair bit of cases we will miss and allow to work if we aren’t somewhat strict in HCWs isolating when symptomatic. My wifes hospital is canceling all non emergency surgeries, pretty much just because the lack of PPE I would love to see them get interviewed and try to explain why they chose now of all times to take a completely impromptu road trip. I think in a few weeks Americans will have VERY strong negative feelings towards that kind of completely irresponsible behavior.I literally told my friend, who is objectively brilliant and very well-liked, you could literally be responsible for multiple deaths and never realize it. I have it in writing over text... But that just wasn\\'t a persuasive argument somehow. This past week has honestly changed my opinion on human nature. Personal protective equipment, ie masks, gloves, etc The only issue for the re-usable respirators is that you have to disinfect everything except the filter parts of it before donning/doffing, otherwise you risk infection. They’re unavailable too It’s not about congress moving slow or the president promising to make them available. It hasn’t happened.  End of story.  They need to make it happen NOW otherwise we as healthcare workers are literally enabling the problem to get worse. Is there any _benefit_ to Paracetamol or NSAIDS in COVID.? I have seen several reports of NSAIDs being harmful, and some for paracetamol worsening outcomes in viral infections. Given this, I’m tempted to say just don’t give any paracetamol or NSAIDS unless temperature rises drastically to harmful levels. Would this lead to any harm? Personal Protective Equipment. Exactly.  I’ve seen reports in local news about staff reusing masks.  The FDA and CDC both support this practice in times of critical shortage.  It’s time we alert people that we’re in that period of crisis. Personal Protective Equipment, things like isolation gowns, gloves, &amp; masks. Personal protective equipment I\\'m trying to predict patient flow for my local area. Does anyone have any timeline-type references/resources that I can compare to my anecdotal impression of the emergency department? I\\'ve listened to many of the podcasts from Italian physicians and I feel like I should be anticipating a surge of pneumonias any minute. We started seeing quite a few r/o\\'s about a week ago, and have steadily increased this volume so that about 30% of our census have been symptomatic rule outs as of this weekend. That being said, we have not had very many fulminant cases - maybe 5-10 that I am aware of in the last week or so (my last week\\'s shifts have all been ED - surprise surprise).It doesn\\'t help that our testing remains limited, and with a 3-5 day turnaround still common. My mom is also super religious, lives in south GA. Her church still hasn\\'t canceled services...even though an entire family is in self quarantine due to their (adult) son who lives with them having all the symptoms and is a presumptive case.She refuses to stop attending. She and my dad are both in the high risk group. I explained that asymptomatic people can spread this, and that all it takes is one person in that group to inadvertently spread it to everyone else. Didn\\'t make a difference. Though I did just see that Trump is saying to avoid groups of more than 10 people, so maybe now she\\'ll listen 🙄 I work in an outpatient clinic as well. No PPE available.  It’s on backorder until the end of April.  Doctors are shutting down the office tomorrow and only doing virtual visits.  I support this 100%.  I’d rather lose my job and my paycheck then lose my life or be the reason why another person loses theirs.  My husband is going to work in critical care ONLY IF he has access to N95s.  It’s not hard to see that sick or dead nurses and doctors can’t help anyone.  I don’t understand why individuals voluntarily give up their rights, it only makes the situation worse for everyone. Personal Protective Equipment. Read: Mask/respirator, gloves. Personal Protective Equipment. In this case, referring to masks, face shields, gloves and isolation gowns. Personal Protective Equipment I bought a P100 mask, protects the same as N95 but includes oils, reusable, you can decon it, and currently I haven\\'t seen any shortages of the masks or filter inserts. Also much more comfortable thus more likely to be used.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24011377/ Removed due to Rule 2 Bro that means \"Dipshit tourist\" What is PPE? Improper PPE = unsafe working conditions = right to protest.  Especially during a pandemic when my lack of PPE means that I could potentially infect dozens of others.  To be clear, the teachers didn’t actually strike. They just organized to make it happen if absolutely necessary.  In the same way, healthcare workers could organize to demand access to the national stockpiles of PPE NOW.  And not wait until there are 1000s of us sick and dying as patients on the very units were supposed to staff.... No. 1 rule of ems - don\\'t give somebody else TWO people to save I support any nurse in refusing to work unless they are provided proper PPE.  Period.Edit: spelling austria here. we completed the shutdown today, only providing emergency care now, discharged as many patients as possible. working hour restrictions are suspended, we\\'ll go back to 36h+ shifts and we reduced staff at the hospital to about 20% for now, although i don\\'t expect this to last long. we\\'ll start working in small teams (2 -3 people) from tomorrow on to reduce the impact of quarantine measures. while we are supposed to be the last hospital to treat covid cases in the city, the doubling rate is alarmingly high (\\\\~2.3 days) and we expect a surge sometime next week. pretty surreal feeling right now. I thought there were some in Singapore?  ICU nurse here, we have been lotted to one mask per day if patient is regular droplet (flu/mycoplasm,RSV;etc.) When the patient is POI (person of interest - suspected covid19) we treat them as droplet and are able to throw away masks after use. Only until confirmed positive are we allowed to use face shields, BUT with only a droplet mask still.   Our hospital did not prepare and is trying to order masks late in the game. 10 ICU staff have been sent home on quarantine leave primarily nurses and respiratory.  ICU doctor stated he expects to get sick and would rather get it over with and take up a hospital bed now before it gets terrible. Wash ur hands muh dudes. Not to mention they may not be able to come back home! Then they\\'ll be interviewed on TV as casualties of the terrible lockdown. Gfy! So what does this mean clinically? Like my new ankle tattoo? It means WISDM in Chinese Do you have a link to the sheet you mentioned? I remembered seeing this mentioned (death after a patient appears to recover) but couldn\\'t remember where and wasn\\'t able to find it. Thanks There has been a lot of coverage of this - it was even asked in the White House press conference today. In the legislation being passed, they are trying to allow N95 masks that were made for construction etc by 3M to be used for medical work. They have a LOT more of these - and are making 30 million a month just at 3M. Unfortunately, Congress moves slowly. But expect this to be passed this week and see some supply improvement through an infusion of these masks. Shouting out my RTs forever they\\'ve saved my ass so many times when my pt is trying to die on me or something. Love when they show up when I\\'m in a crunch. Thanks! Fury warrior... Yeah, that\\'s the US. Oh my goodness. Our respiratory therapists are not forgotten over here. You all roam the halls and have had my patients\\' backs time and time again and I am confident that y\\'all will have my back through this pandemic as well. We are a team. All of us. And we are strong, capable, and will make it through this thanks to all of our combined expertise and continued willingness to serve. ✊ Proper translations wouldn\\'t look as cool on a license plate and removes the appeal of \"ooh, Asian proverb much wisdom.\" Keep in mind that a lot of healthcare org inertia comes from heavy baggage around things like regulation and billing that are directed rigidly from the top (i.e. government) down or by other outside factors. [Some places are reporting it in bits and pieces but not getting enough traction?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html)Edited to add that there\\'s a quick mention or 2 of respirators in the article but no real mention of the reality some HCWs are facing. This is exactly what I have heard from other providers in outpatient clinics. I don’t do critical care or anything but like... surely at the point that you’re reusing masks and gloves to that extent you might as well not use PPE? I can’t tell if I’m in the minority for finding this disturbing. i have come to realize that the space between my nose and my upper lip looks ridiculous. This goes for your friendly neighborhood clinical engineering techs that receive the call to fix your monitor that\\'s showing a low battery / won\\'t stop beeping / can\\'t get patient information in too.

[deleted] Just so I\\'m clear what you\\'re suggesting, you want healthcare workers to strike until hospitals close? During a pandemic? [removed] Minutes to hours, for damage.  But it sounds like you\\'re very in tune with the granular need to control this, and you should reach out to your local hospital or the academic center nearest you to speak to the Pulm/Critical Care docs there. I\\'m a spoiled rotton community EM physician who doesn\\'t have to care for boarded vented ICU patients, so it\\'s been about 5 years since I\\'ve thought very seriously about any of this.  But here\\'s a great well written link to a smart EM/Critical Care blog piece about the implications of messing around with vents which may serve your purposes.   He\\'s coming at it from the idea of splitting a vent between two patients and what that would mean.  (This was actually done on the fly to help trauma patients survive the Las Vegas mass shooting event, which is very different medically as those are young patients not presumed to have lung disease or infectious illness who could be matched up by approx lung volume and had no unusual concerns about lung compliance or oxygenation).   [https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/) Are there any risks of that being hard to come up with or taking more than say a year? I am sure that would be an excellent business now. And really useful for countries to follow up the spread and immunity and establish how well the strategies are working. We\\'re hearing from the Italians that lung compliance tends to be good. Same deal here. Additionally asked not to bring trauma teams into CT area - send 1 person and leave everyone else behind. I agree with you that it\\'s scary and dangerous. The problem is, us not wanting to expose ourselves won\\'t magically make PPE appear. There\\'s a global shortage. This isn\\'t a situation where strike action (formal or informal) means we can influence leaders and effect change to make it safer. Anyone without risk factors refusing to work with the (suboptimal) PPE we have is just increasing the strain on the system. I\\'m not saying any individual has to do it if they don\\'t want to, but don\\'t mistake it for stupidity or a lack of awareness in colleagues who choose to still work as one of the least worst options available. My mother isn\\'t quite Goop level but is attracted to natural remedies like a toddler with bubbles.  I find this article to be very helpful - an MD integrative medicine specialist, but the good kind, and it goes in depth about how we need to first of all make certain that our natural remedies don\\'t interfere with evidence based care, and then appeases her by going into depth about various herbs and stuff.

Teachers planned a sick out in NYC and suddenly the schools closed, RNs need to follow. Why are all proverbs translated without grammar? \"Saving a doctor saves lives.\" Gonna find out tonight. I almost got into an argument with a friend who told me she got a hold of 100 masks and that it wasn\\'t her fault that others weren\\'t prepared for this while she was amassing 4-6 weeks of food for herself and her son. I told her if anything please donate the extra masks. Meanwhile, yeah, this. Reusing masks and gowns and everything, that\\'s so unsafe for the staff. Ughhhh I\\'m always jealous of the US. I wish we had respiratory therapists here, I don\\'t think people here recognise how important good vent settings are to a patients outcome I\\'m expected to manage medications, cares and the ventilator in Australia. It\\'s sad but they won\\'t listen because that hot topic they\\'re spewing hot garbage about is what keeps the listener captivated. It\\'d be nice to silence the uninformed but alas, the means are not there at this time. [deleted] RN here. PPE shortages are REAL.  Why isn’t the media all over this?  Yes there aren’t enough ventilators...but my local hospital sent out an email informing all clinical staff that they are to wear THE SAME SURGICAL MASK for days or weeks until it is visibly soiled or broken...N95s under lock and key.  What are the conditions like in your hospital/facility? What about reusing surgical masks and gloves between patients for an entire day? As in, taking them on and off? I\\'m curious about the myocarditis secondary to COVID-19. What is its onset relative to time of exposure/onset of symptoms? Have there been any predictors for who has gotten it? Any effective treatments? Yeah. I\\'ve submitted it as a text post to the subreddit, hopefully more people can see it that way.The full report is really something. Excellent, thank you. Key points from the summary:&gt; We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. Mitigation works, but not well enough.&gt;Suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \\\\[...\\\\] will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. Suppression is of course optimal from a purely epidemiological perspective, but can we bear the costs of shutting down huge parts of our economy for an extended period of time?Looking forward to reading the full report when I have time, great find. &gt; (emphasis mine) I\\'ve had a **chest pressure almost like you feel like you\\'ve done a big chest workout**. I\\'ve had a little bit of a cough. I had a relatively mild fever. I\\'ve had kind of weird aches and pains in places I\\'m not used to. But honestly, I feel like I\\'ve had colds and flus worse than this. **I\\'ve never been totally out for the whole day in bed.** I\\'ve been up, able to talk with people. So for me, luckily, it\\'s been quite mild.Considering it\\'s not ARDS, yes it might be mild COVID19 but that sounds pretty severe in my professional opinion, lol I\\'m not doing telehealth, but my understanding was that for medicare you use E&amp;M codes + a telehealth modifier, though im not sure the modifier, 95, GT, or something else. I caught that. I meant \"keep going\" with the other spelling mishaps, but it\\'s not your job. Me? I work in the \"a/an\" pet-peeve department. i know..........dont do it Right?? I dont understand the logic of these patients. Also frustrated at my residency program for not taking it more seriously and only allowing urgent appointments at our clinic. Infuriating. There’s no discharge in the war Yes! I want to tweet it. There’s such a huge medical presence in Twitter. Just not sure how easy it is to track and fire me. &gt; _sighs_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should.Fuck Trump and his shithole administrration. (from an american) YES. As Koreans been saying, SAVE DR SAVE LIFE. Applies to other health prof ofc. isnt it enraging? It sounds like there are pretty considerable reasons why the rads residents can\\'t work from home. I dunno, I feel more concern for the EM/gas/ICU fellows who have to be exposed to aerosolized secretions to be honest. Here\\'s the data underlying the UK government\\'s response - and they\\'ve modelled the US as well. This is the report that has resulted in the UK\\'s latest social distancing measures.Highlights include: deaths in the US of approximately 1 million people. Peak demand more than 8x greater ICU surge capacity in both the US and UK. Any social distancing measures must be in place until a vaccine is disseminated.Report 9https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/ I think our best guess at this comes from comparing the curves of the pace at which new cases were identified.  I found one graph that implies we have tried to establish quarantine a few days ahead of where Italy was, which sounds hopeful.  On the other hand, they have more hospital beds per capita than we do, which is depressing.  \"your laying in a hospital bed\" Just correcting my pet peeve ;) Keep going... Very well worded comment. It might just save lives. All of the coronavirus-related articles on NY times site are free but you\\'ll have to create an account. Hope this helps. Looking at this article, the design I\\'m envisioning would follow the \"biphasic ventilation\" model seen about 2/3 the way down this link.  It\\'d be a disposable connection set that would take advantage of an existing intermitting suction regulator and a positive pressure source to create the alternation needed for breathing. Both pressures would be fully adjustable by clinicians.  So while there\\'d be no automation available, it might be manageable if there were enough hands but not enough ventilators.https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/304068-overview#a7What timescale does the harm you\\'re referring to occur across? It could sort of fit under the code blue admonishment of checking your own pulse first. I agree it would’ve explicitly been in there if it were more timely. EXACTLY. If we can give front line workers extra time to fix the shortages of PPE and critical care equipment, we\\'re helping them (which means saving not only their lives, but their patients as well) Have there been any studies/surveys showing that HCWs actually are getting higher rates of severe disease? I agree. As a radiology resident, I\\'m OK with my attendings--many of whom are much older than me--staying home and working from there rather than risk getting infected. We might need some attendings for any urgent procedures, but otherwise, us seniors can handle a lot on our own.And like Boomboomgel said, home reading stations are expensive. You should not use just any old computer monitor, for example, as they may not provide the adequate luminance and resolution for optimal diagnostic decisions. Further details are available in the ACR-AAPM-SIIM Technical Standard for Electronic Practice of Medical Imaging. Good advice. Thank you. It\\'s probably important to remember scale. 0.2% is still 60,000 20-35 year olds dead at 50% saturation. That doesn\\'t even account for hospitalizations or long term lung damage. That’s fair. Good points. I’ve got no problem with someone putting an amethyst in their shoe or whatever, as long as that person is taking other precautions. Unfortunately, this kind of balanced, dual approach does not appear to be the norm. Paywall for me? New meta-analysis of of Covid-19 out on preprint. Key findings: dyspnoea key predictive symptom for ICU admission and severe disease; COPD, cardiovascular disease and hypertension also predictive.https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1 Any links or texts that explain the minutiae of it I could look into? No antibody tests currently but I’m sure there will be in the future Just took a knee for you I agree, both these cases surpassed my expectation of mild I\\'m sorry, you absolutely are and vital! ahh enjoy your comp! Best type of vacation cause no guilty feelings for turning into a complete potato. Though I have to clean up, the state of my apartment is.... well, nightshift mess. It was actually my first time working nightshift ever. Yeah. I wonder what the world will look like in 2 weeks... or a month? How our daily lives will look like... German study N=9 of viral shedding characteristics in confirmed Covid patients. Very high viral load early in illness, approx 1000 times greater than SARS. At DAY 8 of active symptoms, no longer able to detect active virus in samples, only viral RNA. Only viral RNA in feces, never detected active virus.They\\'re following up now with N=23 cohort.[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1) I mean the ED is about to go completely bonkers. The EM docs already don\\'t like the turn around time for scans. I suppose outpatient imaging will be down so hopefully that\\'ll make up for the increase in volume. They absolutely *will* fire people.  Hospitals are not run by doctors, they’re run by businessmen. This is exactly how I feel and I am so frustrated. I told him he just needs to wear a mask for each patient. If they run out don’t go in because it’s not worth it for anyone - his patients, his family, his own health given his age and HPN Dynamic control of volume and pressure are required, these are both moving targets that progress as the illness evolves over a few days and under or over doing it causes real harm Well they don\\'t have home reading stations, for starters. Those stations are very expensive. But also radiologists do perform procedures, go down to the ED on occasion for various things related to the scans like consenting people and such. And it leaves the PGY5s kind of out there, in that they\\'ll be the primary folks supervising the PGY4-2s. So it\\'ll be like it is when they\\'re on call except it\\'s during the day and during a pandemic. IDK, I\\'m probably just being irritable. To me it just seems like if from a nursing standpoint all the charge nurses and nurse managers were just like \"Ok guys, good luck! I\\'ll be available by telephone if you need me!\" Anybody have thoughts on how to best utilize home health services if we end up getting a bed crunch?  If people are just requiring supplemental O2 would it not be reasonable to try for early discharge and home management? There are so many things going on at our institution that are making me uncomfortable also. This is not going to go well. This makes a lot of sense While I agree with what you are saying, it’s unfortunate that Respiratory Therapists weren’t mentioned when we are just as on the front lines as you nurses. We’ll be intubating these people. And managing their vents. I don’t have the links at hand but there is a pdf on the CDC website and there are videos from Britain’s NHS out there. Both are good. Also, simply searching YouTube videos from trusted sources (med centers, government agencies, etc) is what I’ve been telling people to do. Anyone doing telehealth in Primary care?  How are you doing your visit coding?I think this is the correct CMS referrence but it is listing codes like 99215.  Does it need a modifier to indicate telelhealth?https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/TelehealthSrvcsfctsht.pdf so if it\\'s old people and attractive young people, does that mean I\\'m excluded from getting the virus lol *you\\'re You get the local DA office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. this was posted previously:https://emcrit.org/ibcc/covid19/#personal_protective_equipment_(PPE) Probably reporting (media) bias. If there\\'s 100 cases,  99 older and 1 attractive young person,  who is the media going to report on? Not saying it doesn\\'t happen,  but these rare cases do seem to be circulated a lot more than the standard ones. I\\'m guessing the fury warrior pulled aggro. Honestly, minimizing risk for ANY healthcare worker is imperative at this moment. Why risk infecting a radiologist who can provide diagnostic support during the coming surge from afar? Unless I’m mistaken, is it essential that they are present in the hospital during the outbreak? We need all hands on deck but that can come in many forms. Unnecessary exposure will just cause more spread and more problems.  You get the local attorney office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. Why can\\'t residents work from home Exactly. We\\'ve not even begun the war against covid, so to speak and we\\'re already dangerously low of PPE. It\\'s reassuring to hear from a fellow colleague with a level head. We need to be protecting ourselves first, and not act heroic and kill ourselves and in turn, other colleagues and patients. OURS. Thanks. We\\'re out here on the front line with no rapid testing and no PPE. There\\'s no other industry in *existence* that would be asked to work under those conditions. You stay home to slow this thing down until someone figures out how to properly protect health care employees.It\\'s the LEAST we deserve for taking this burden on. Glad to see some action in major cities. I\\'m in NYC, and the streets are getting a bit emptier but not as empty as I hoped. There\\'s still quite a few people commuting to work and hanging out in groups. Public schools are closed and transitioning to online learning until April 20, universities have moved online for the foreseeable future and some have kicked students out of dorms. Restaurants and bars are either closed or takeout/delivery only - many are struggling trying to pay their employees. Nightclubs, movie theaters, and concert venues are closed. We have a covid patient who presented as presumed STEMI later determined to be likely viral myocarditis. My hospital is wasting N95 masks on elective cases today.We’ve been told over and over - “business as usual”Our elective surgeries continue to flow in. And now, due to concern about ‘aerosolization’, OR staff are being told to wear N95 masks for some of these cases.So to recap - still doing elective cases. Burning through N95 masks.Does anyone know if I can make an anonymous Twitter handle and tweet about this without getting doxed? The system here is already fucked because we don\\'t even have enough PPE. We absolutely need to slow down the spread. What characteristics of a ventilator are critical to their function that this would miss?  I know not having them electronically follow the patients\\' breathing patterns is not ideal, but it would seem something that forced them into a regular 4 second breathing pattern would be a better than nothing.  I\\'m talking in a scenario like Italy has where some patients are simply not getting any respiratory support due to a shortage of equipment.  Adding negative pressure rooms to our list. My hospital system is treating everyone with respiratory symptoms as droplet precautions from now until ? LEEEERRROOOOYYYYYYYYYY Neither of these cases seem mild to me, and certainly not enough to blame on a gym workout! Mild enough to blow off to me is a day or two of sore throat and sniffles and back to normal. Sure, but his comment didn\\'t specify that those things weren\\'t taken into account. People with asthma don\\'t necessarily get more severe illness with this strain according to some of the preliminary data. There is not nearly enough data to give you much more than that. one trillion upvotes- more of my questions answered How many lives? This is great. Would you be up for reposting this as a separate thread for maximum exposure? Ha I also have comp after night shift this week. I’m supposed to be in clinic next week but I have no idea what that will look like. Kite them!  Kite them! As a healthcare worker with asthma and also I\\'m fat, how fucked am I?  Other than using recommended PPE, any recommendations?  Nursing staff ain\\'t always the healthiest bunch.Edit: I\\'m on a med surg floor once a week. &gt; EDIT: how can I explain to my father that he needs to tell the office manager that it does not make sense to only wear a mask after you’ve been in contact with a patient with COVID-19 and everyone should be wearing one when interacting with patients?You can\\'t fix stupid China did, then I\\'m not sure if a hunter misdirected, or someone ran away from the group, but theres adds everywhere now What a pisspoor idea. I feel like they are leaving the residents out to dry. Look into how to create negative pressure rooms.  We need a lot more than we have, and working at a suction device manufacturer makes you keenly suited to the task.  Good luck! I personally haven\\'t seen stats that say otherwise. It simply seems the quantity of elderly facing this disease is far overshadowing the numbers in younger people.Percentage wise, younger people are less at risk, but the risk is still non-zero (and seemingly much higher than the flu). Good bot. My department is having daily town hall meetings. Via Microsoft Teams (virtual town hall). pull the fire alarm before it starts? &gt;.&lt; seriously, try to send the message up the chain how bad of an idea that is. We suspended all stuff like that two weeks or so ago. Why are you pissed? It is reddit, you are American until proven otherwise :pbut yeah... unfortunately the global trend seems to follow the US atm... \\\\_sighs\\\\_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should. A lot of churches are doing their services online which is smart. Sounds more like constant emergency 24/7. I\\'m not jealous of them. But I respect the fuck out of their work! Here’s another interesting first hand account of a mild case from someone with confirmed pcr:https://www.facebook.com/EbethBerkeley/posts/10110434821081713Claimed symptoms paint an interesting picture Hahahaha I did not notice that! I am so not correcting that... On the [This Week in Virology podcast](http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) prof Ralph Baric had the intriguing hypothesis that the endemic human coronaviruses that cause the common cold could have been very serious sars like diseases for adults when initially introduced from animals. This would have the implication that the only reason they are not deadly now is that we develop immunity from exposure as children and then get mild disease as adults when re-infected. If this is true then SARS-2 will eventually become the 3rd human coronavirus that causes just the common cold in people.A highly recommended listen! &gt; Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.Hopefully in a few months we\\'ll have a better handle (more PPE, more vents, more beds, more knowledge, more treatment options) on this than we do now... Buying time saves lives. Your message is *super* important, and will hopefully help keep people alive.In a previous era of life, I had a long and full career in law enforcement.  I used to teach new, young, gung-ho academy graduates that when you\\'re responding to an emergency call, a crime in progress, etc., with lights and siren going, to do the following:  Drive only a small, reasonable bit above the speed limit, and maybe at or below the speed limit.  Stop at every single red light and stop sign.  Completely stop.  Wait a second or three.  Look around. Make sure everyone has stopped for you.  *Then* go through it and continue on.   Don\\'t drive faster than the sound from your siren.  Stay far enough back from traffic you\\'re coming up to and be patient to let them have time to hear your siren and notice your lights in their mirror(s) and get out of your way.You **must** be wearing your bulletproof vest, **every** day, no matter the duty, location, season, temperature, humidity, etc.You **must** get out of your car slowly.

I know you meant \"re-exposed\" but somehow \"re exploded\" is just as fitting :( It\\'s very sad, but it\\'s not a direct pathology of the disease. The thought would be “are you kidding me” WHOAH WHO SAID I WAS REFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES?! Just messing.... I was :( Luks? Yeah we are not there yet (USB). They are starting to cancel electives and have said that we can be moved to other duties. I will be reading up on relevant things this week (I have comp week after a week of nightshift). Honestly don\\'t know what I\\'ll be returning to next week. Referral specialist for an HMO here - still getting a ton of referrals for non-urgent issues.  I\\'m a little dumbfounded at how many people want to see the doctor right now for their moles or their genetic testing...you know, the things that can wait 2 weeks?  Very frustrating to see. Yes. My girlfriend is from Texas and I am so glad that 1st I was born here and 2nd I was finally able to bring her here last summer. Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now. My husband is all \"Eh, shit rolls downhill\" but I\\'m pissed. Is this the norm in radiology departments elsewhere during this crisis? https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/tagesschau-spezial/video/medienkonferenz-des-bundesrates-zum-coronavirus?id=6329d7d0-e1e9-4221-a091-3dbba7b7fd43here (in German/French/Italian/Romantsch obv). Skip to 5:00 to hear the opening speech.  It feels. Warm. I rarely feel like I am part of something, but rn I kinda do. I hesitate to say \"proud\" because it isn\\'t like I did anything for it. Relief knowing that our government actually tries to help the people.   You have to understand the difference in system. The executive branch is the federal council, consisting of 7 members distributed proportionally to the share of vote that the parties got. So there are right and left wing and center people in there but they always speak with one voice towards the outside. There is no party politics involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland) if you wanna read some about it) Or the hospital will give it to them.....my hospital just came out with the same policy to continue Spain was partying a week ago while Italy was starting to be ravaged.  Now they know and are trying to tell us to do the same.Icarus..... Anyone got a good presentation about Proper ppe for covid 19? Or any good source. Much Appreciated. They don\\'t care. Our CMO sent out an email saying electives will go on. It was replied to by the President and CEO congratulating her for not falling into the \"hype\". This is a large, multi state regional enterprise/level 1 trauma center.  Hope none of the dozen+ cataract cases or hundred other electives brought us a surprise thank you gift today. Must be nice to have a government that puts its people above politics Okay but who\\'s tanking this boss?

In the context of COVID-19.](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang)\"13 Mar 2020Based on initial reports from China, and subsequent evidence that arterial hypertension may be associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 infected subjects, hypotheses have been put forward to suggest a potential adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). It has been suggested, especially on social media sites, that these commonly used drugs may increase both the risk of infection and the severity of SARS-CoV2. The concern arises from the observation that, similar to the coronavirus causing SARS, the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs.\\xa0Because of the social media-related amplification, patients taking these drugs for their high blood pressure and their doctors have become increasingly concerned, and, in some cases, have stopped taking their ACE-I or ARB medications.This speculation about the safety of ACE-i or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scientific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is no data in humans.The [Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)) wish to highlight **the lack of any evidence**supporting harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.The Council on Hypertension **strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the Covid-19 infection.** *Prof. Giovanni de Simone,**Chair, ESC Council on Hypertension**On behalf of the Nucleus Members\"* I\\'m not sure what to believe... we have so many reports of young people critically ill, but stats say otherwise... what do you guys think? Obviously this is a question everyone has People need to stop standing in fire I know. It\\'s a terrible situation. World-changing situation. I really don\\'t know what the world is going to look like in a year. &gt; We\\'re being threatenedI\\'m not in the US and this is a terrible situation they are putting you in, but they are not going to fire medical staff with this going on.  Stand firm and get your colleagues to stand firm, insist on the PPE or walk out until it\\'s there.  As the post above says you can\\'t help anyone for the time you\\'re down with the virus (or dead) If you\\'re refusing report because you don\\'t have proper PPE, I believe you\\'d win the argument. If you\\'re refusing because you\\'re scared, you\\'d probably lose. In my community, it\\'s the boomers who are flippant about this and think it won\\'t affect them. I just got into it today with one of them about closing her yoga studio and deleting her posts about how wellness based lifestyle can prevent illness... Just to say, please don\\'t turn this into an Us vs Them thing. There are idiots in all age groups. Yep. Analyzing clinical presentation and symptoms does not work well for us. The very first patient tested positive at our ER had nothing more than a sore throat and got tested because he attended a carnival attend which became infamous for spread (at a point where there were still no cases). Guy was a homework tutor at an elementary school, luckily of over 220 tested children and parents none positive but this could have easily gone south if the ER didn\\'t fish him out.  This is all public information revealed in press conferences and articles at this point, if you are concerned about confidentiality. Awesome information! This is just what I was looking for. Now I just need to brush up on my German. Same here lol. Came in this morning and noticed that quite a few of us had shaved clean over the weekend, the initial shock as we saw each other’s beardless faces after years was great.

WHO pulls their US numbers from [CDC\\'s page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html), which is reporting just over 1600 cases while the actual number of positives [sits at over 4100](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en).P.S.

Thanks! The amount of bull shit I hear from radio hosts in the car is astounding. It’s more mild than the flu, it’s the media, it’s a left wing political move. It’s insane that these people are even allowed to make comments about it. I’ve tried to call in to at least warn them that they should leave those kinds of statements to people in the medical field without luck. &gt; Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown?What\\'s the goal behind \"shut everything down\"?  Realistically, we are not going to get the infection rate to 0 even if we shut everything down for a couple months.  Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.  The time where a total shutdown is needed is if we get into an Italy or Wuhan situation where the system is overrun.  Then it makes sense to knock the infections down to a point where they can be handled.The changes that need to be made are the ones that slow the spread while normal life continues.  Shutting everything down is a delaying tactic and not a permanent solution Oh.  Oh boy. I hadn’t been clean shaven in a decade. I look like a high schooler. The inevitable ingrown hairs while my skin adjusts will really complete the teenager look. Here\\'s the [CDC guidelines for breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fpregnancy-faq.html) as a person with known or suspected covid 19. That might be helpful as you\\'re trying to figure out the best course of action. Thanks so much for mentioning more possible symptoms to look out for! Thanks so much! :) Why hasn\\'t WHO released a daily sitrep today? Pardon the really weird analogy from video games.Something I learned playing MMORPGs - We have a bit of wisdom when 20+ people are fighting bosses:\"Dead Damage Dealers do no damage. Dead Healers do no healing.\"The throughput of those alive are infinitely better than those who are dead (or incapacitated). It is not worth that extra bit of throughput if it will cost your life. Contributions will be much greater alive than dead.It is totally the turtle and the hare situation, except instead of the hare slacking off, it\\'s the hare being sick.EDIT: To add - \"When the Healers are dead, everyone is dead.\" Real Life Healthcare Professionals, take care of yourselves. You\\'re too important to lose. We\\'re being threatened, the union is trying but getting stonewalled. It doesn\\'t help the CDC keeps changing the recommendations. Who do we believe! The Chinese in ground zero wearing HazMat? Or the CDC who ( and this may have changed now, hopefully, without my knowledge ) was only letting one company manufacturer COVID19 Tests??I asked what would happen if we refused to accept report on assignments with a COVID19 patient and I haven\\'t gotten an answer. Thank you for being human and trying to help out. I don\\'t think your ventilator idea would work, however if your machines can create negative pressure rooms that would be greatly needed. Thanks! I appreciate it. : ) Math is a thing used by epidemiologists, who take into account important things like disease latency, incubation periods, true incidence vs. apparent incidence, etc.Nothing about math teaches you that. Only the other way around. I’m about to shave mine. I’m a new attending and look like a med student without it. Working on the ED I don’t think it’s feasible to use the PAPR that often for the number of people I’m gonna have to put on BiPAP or tube.Question: are we now assuming every COPD exacerbation has COVID-19 until proven otherwise? Called to a code last night (pharmacist). Our boss said we shouldn’t go to codes of COVID patients bc we are non essential and need to save PPE. We are told to keep the med drawer of the cart outside the room along with rsi kit and hand meds in. I’m not sure what that is going to look like. Last night I asked if isolation patient and the response I got was “not yet”. Arrested at home after a couple days cheat pain. So I go to the code and the MD is fully PPE covered, mask and face shield. No one else is. I’m wondering- are ED physicians just wearing garb the whole shift? I can’t imagine keeping it on and walking from room to room but I am not up there full time so I don’t know. Yah but what are healthcare professionals suppose to do with the lack of prep? The people voted for this current administration... I hope for nurses and doctors sake that they strike after all this. Hard too. They are put at unnecessary risk because of our current state of healthcare. Should be done, thanks for the reminder! I suggest we add an exception to rule #10 specifically for [reacting to healthcare workers who\\'ve had to shave :(](https://giphy.com/gifs/afv-americas-funniest-home-videos-26vUN2RR48dddT1Cg) You do not see patients until you get any. You close down until you do. You can not put yourself at risk. this needs its own thread.. Yes, the number of antecdotal reports is alarming. As of yesterday, the German national status report of the RKI has 3024 cases with full clinical data. Only 39% of these positive tested patients presented with fever! (Source in German: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-03-15-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) I agree 1,000% with you. Just yesterday one of my good friends announced to me that he and two others are taking a road trip south. Mind you they work in NYC, and mind you that just on Saturday they attended a party with 10+ nurses who work at a hospital with confirmed covid. I tried explaining why it was an absolutely horrible and selfish idea to go at this time. He responded \"points taken\" and today I got a picture from a friend of a friend of them on the road. I still can\\'t fucking believe it. I never understood how arrogant and selfish the average American is. What do we do if our hospital has no more P.P.E. What criteria are CDC using for \"recovery\"? There was an internist cheat sheet I saw the other day from Italy that described the above. It basically said don’t trust the first patient rally. I believe a lot of our ignorance is due to the fact of information overload. There are thousands upon thousands of people telling us to do X or Y. One physician says wear masks, another says don’t. Things like these take a toll on the regular American Citizen. Also anyone can post on the internet. Those on the corona subreddit. Or news. Or world news. Are their posts always true? Nope but it’s not like it matters. The moderators on the forums (not even exclusively Reddit), are they healthcare professionals? Nah probably not. Then we turn to the administration, are they professionals? Nah. No, that\\'s not how epidemiology works. If it did, epidemiology wouldn\\'t exist. State of emergency for all of Switzerland. All non-essential stores and public venues closed. Strongly suggested to stay home. Home office if at any way possible. For risk population wages are guaranteed even if home office is not an option. Army will be deployed to help hospitals. Call for all Swiss abroad on vacation to come home. Closing of the borders for non-essential travel.I almost cried. Finally. Also great somber speech of our president. She emphasized the important points in all 4 languages. With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.  So in theory while you would have unlimited resources and be in full PPE the reality is going to be healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should. I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required. My wife is an ER physician and we have a 4 week old baby. She will likely be returning to work earlier than planned due to the virus.  We are hoping she can stay out at least a few more weeks.Stay safe everyone. Humanity\\'s arrogance. Shit like this has happened everywhere. Just look at the members of that church/cult? in SK. We are seeing lots of exhaustion, depression, even suicide in stressed out systems.  I know nothing about this particular case, but non COVID causes are certainly plausible. Agree Hmm. If that is Covid that would be an entirely new presentation.... Myocarditis and arrest is becoming more reported, and more commonly how young folks are dying I am literally in an argument with my best-friend cousin about whether or not this is a big deal. She lives in DC, I live in Seattle. She is not listening to me. She is angry her son is missing 2 weeks of school. I\\'m worried I might be homeless in 6 months. Or dead. But those are healthy, compliant lungs. Totally different if you have intrinsic lung disease.It may still come to it, but don’t expect miracles. The wonderful thing about math is that it can be checked by anyone who knows their stuff. Maybe this \"chucklehead\" is a crank, maybe not, but unless you\\'re good at math and have checked their numbers yourself, your dismissal of it seems like another form of anti-intellectualism to me. There were a lot of nerdy people ringing the alarm bell on this disease weeks before the mainstream picked up on it, and I saw a lot of this same \"who made you an expert?\" attitude among people who were in denial up until recently, or even still. I’m glad you’re taking this level of care in your planning. I like all your ideas. I know hospitals that aren’t this regimented! I have nothing to add but I’m so thankful for people like you who are taking it seriously. F [removed] My hypothesis is that the economy is on the verge of crumbling.&amp;#x200B; Businesses will go under, leading to layoffs, which will lead to less spending, which will lead to businesses going under,which will lead to layoffs, which will lead to less spending. Shall I continue?&amp;#x200B;V 2 of the hypothesis is that they are already aware they must scale back, however the markets are hyper-reactive and emotional so you cannot just announce \\'\\'we\\'re stopping all flights, mandating all businesses closed and a curfew after 6pm\". The trump announcement on european travel ban created a massive drop in the market after hours.The worrying part is that once it comes out that the hospitals aren\\'t able to help everyone, then we will see the true gruesome nature of this pandemic.It is right about that time people will realize \\'\\'oh jeez, more serious than I thought\\'\\' I would like a moment of silence for my facial hair - I am going to shave tonight. The one N95 mask I have been permitted to have for each clinical encounter in my clinic needs to do the best it can.I fear my daughter will not know who i am.If you have went back to looking like a teenager as I will soon do, please offer any words of comfort you may have. F Is there currently a way to test if you have had a previous infection by Covid-19? If not will it be possible in a close future? I figure this will be even more interesting in the coming weeks to understand how the herd immunity status is. And also when a lot of countries are only testing seriously ill patients. I assume the current tests only spill the news of a potential on-going infection? everyone will catch the shit out of this virus AFAIK all the hospitals in Seattle have put a stop those. I\\'m not even bothering to go see my ortho this week. No point now. &gt; For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis Hahaha!Shit. :( Call your governor’s office.  Local government.  Tell other parents to do the same.  The state superintendent’s office needs to hear your concerns! As a Seattlite, I love that idea. I hate what it means for our city, but I love that idea! she may need to pump and let you give that to them. uptodate mentions trying to be as careful as possible but i can\\'t imagine how you avoid transmission during breastfeeding given the baby is directly in line with your respiration. &gt; But everything floating around is hearsay. We all need to remember that. I\\'m currently operating under the assumption of higher viral load for HCW causing higher rates of severe disease. All the more reason to adhere to strict PPE. States with any real numbers of cases are taking it seriously. I\\'m in WA and Inslee just closed entertainment places including bars and restaurants. All K-12 are closed, and colleges/unis are doing all online courses through April. I think we\\'re heading for a huge global depression. We MIGHT get a new New Deal out of it, but let\\'s be honest, we don\\'t have much wiggle room right now. We\\'re still in debt as a nation from the last crisis. &gt; IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. They\\'re not, because they didn\\'t get there using logic. You can\\'t logic someone out of a position they hold due to feelings. Thank you! I remember working the ED for months from the floatpool during the Ebola outbreak. Quarantining half of it for dedicated use on presenting pts. No one panicked, but the hair on the back of your neck sure did raise every time that bell rang for new admission. Just remember, you can\\'t help someone else if you\\'re incapacitated. Stay strong everyone, and take care. I wish people in my fathers office would think this way. The CMO told them that until a provider is actually sick, you should keep seeing patients, even after being exposed to someone with the virus. I have to wonder how many other rural clinics are being this cavalier. &gt; But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.I keep trying to tell people on various subreddits that just because they\\'re sick, that doesn\\'t mean they need to be tested. I just keep getting downvoted. If you know they are exceeding the number limit, report them. They will at least get a nice big fine and hopefully not make idiotic choices again, plus the gathering will be broken up. This is so vitally important. It will require very active suppression of honed clinical muscle memories and learned responses. It will not be easy but it is the only way forward. He’s an elderly petulant child Hey there, I noticed previous threads are often automatically set sort by New, is there anyway to change this thread to do the same? (Thank you again for all you’ve done the past few weeks, and in general!) What are you talking about.  One of Trump\\'s desperate staffers was able to grab his phone and make him tweet, \"Social Distancing!\"That\\'ll make all of his dumb%#* followers fall in line right? &gt; I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it\\'s pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though people still find a way...And Seattle has to keep dealing with that jackass [Tim Eyman](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/coronavirus-daily-news-update-march-14-what-to-know-today-about-covid-19-in-the-seattle-area-washington-state-and-the-nation/), calling for a gathering of \"250 patriots\" to flout Jay Inslee\\'s ban on crowds. &gt;There is no emergency in a pandemic.If the book *House of God* took place during a pandemic, this would be one of the rules. Possibly an unpopular opinion.  If you choose to go out to bars or travel you should put your name on a list.  People on the list start at the bottom when it comes to the rationing of medical supplies.  If I’m self isolating and not doing anything risky, I should be able to get a vent before a millennial who doesn’t think their actions have consequences. If you were like me you saw tons of people out this weekend. I don’t think we did enough, soon enough. Closing restaurants and bars before the weekend would have really been great, but at this point you have to think it’s coming a little late. But better late than never. I\\'ve been asked to be part of a testing team and the biggest part of my thought process is my 3600 dollar deductible. It is sad that as a health care provider I have to worry about the massive bill that simply doing my job could end up delivering me. Yes, it seems to follow the pattern of looking well enough for discharge then tanking...i only hope there are enough clinicians out there who are aware to be on the lookout for this and can hopefully prevent some cases from slipping through. My mom is super religius and lives in San Diego (not very hard hit yet). Her church cancelled all activities as of last week. I\\'m VERY happy about that!Now if only Seattle could keep Tim Eyman away from the internet and the outside world for 3 months, that\\'d be great. Is there any large scale data on afebrile presentations of covid-19? There seems to be a belief in the general population that no fever=no coronavirus and much of the screening advice seems to focus around fever as well. [This article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article) describes two younger patients, one who was afebrile throughout the course of the disease and one who was febrile for only 3 days. Both had positive PCR results for at least 20 days. My mom and my RN aunt are harping on my elderly mom with COPD to stay away from people. I am not sure she\\'s listening. But she\\'s proud of me!!! Yay. Simplest answer: no one knows. We were likely too late but we will see in 10-14 days where we are. If we manage to make it through fairly unscathed as a nation then everything we have done will have worked but will be seen by the lay public as overreaction. If it doesn’t work and we end up in an Italy like situation, then I’m afraid the same public will say it didn’t matter what we did, it was gonna happen regardless. In my opinion, I feel that everyone in the country will directly know personal family with this disease. Stuff like that, given our population now, rarely happens. As stated this is just one guy’s opinion, though &gt; and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiologyThere\\'s some chucklehead on /r/CoronavirusWA who keeps posting trend lines of infected and death rates. I asked him why he thought he had the expertise to draw any conclusions from that information, and he said \"I\\'m good at math.\" LOL ok dude. It\\'s to flatten the curve, make sure that people don\\'t all get sick at the same time and overwhelm the medical system.We\\'re not stopping this. It\\'s out there. We\\'ve just got to get through it and meet on the other side of it. She. But it would be a great name for her &gt; Dr actonFor just a second I thought his name was Dr. Action and I was like, \"Yeah, that\\'s fitting!!\" I\\'ve always said that if I were an evil genius and wanted to eradicate a group of anti-vaxxers that the best intervention would be....convince them not to get vaccines. I think that Covid is the equivalent for anti government and anti-science groups. They will catch the shit out of this virus. Nothing in the news yet but a coworker of his facebooked about it; link to COVID is completely unknown at this time, he had not been known to be ill the day before. Simply found inexplicably dead. Medical device R&amp;D engineer here.  I work for a small suction regulator company  and we\\'re trying to see if there\\'s any way for us to help on the supply chain side.We\\'re not equipped to help with high volume things like masks and other PPE, but one thing I keep seeing is a shortage of ventilators in the worst hit areas.  Could a low tech \"ventilator\" that oscillates between a specific positive pressure and a weakly negative pressure/atmospheric pressure be helpful at timed intervals be helpful in scenarios where there aren\\'t enough ventilators go around? Are there any other things I should be looking into? Except of course the 50,000 who died. That is of course the problem with percentages is that it is pretty easy to have 18 times the people who died in the Iraq war and 9/11 when you turn it into a percentage. He already said he takes no responsibility We must spread this wisdom ASAP Engineering orgs are often more forward-thinking than healthcare orginazations, as someone who has worked in both That\\'s not how people will look at it though.  It is:Option 1: 4.95% chance of death and a year+ disruption to economic and social life.Option 2: 5% chance of death and we get it over with in a few months.Pretty much everyone is going to take option 2. I also work for the NHS and have no intention of going down with the ship (if it\\'s sinking due to lack of PPE).  If we run out of PPE, I am not going near Covid-19.  There are many stories of young healthcare workers getting very ill and dying from Covid even with PPE. It\\'s scary and downright dangerous that the virus has barely scratched the NHS and many trusts are already running low on vital PPE. I\\'m currently reading PFTs (Pulm/CC Fellow) and trying to get my department to cancel all the PFTs and exercise tests. The only part of these that is closed to outside air is the lung volumes, so all these susceptible patients with COPD etc are going to be spraying droplets all over the room with a RT and sometimes a fellow who are going to be badly needed when shit hits the fan. Thanks for posting this. You’ve highlighted my thoughts exactly. The thing is, I (working for the NHS) don’t want to crash along with it. Nor do I want the NHS or the UK to crash, but that’s not something I can control! I have coworkers who are openly talking about having their own big at Patrick’s day party tomorrow at their house because all the bars are closed and in defiance of the 100 person limit in our state. Literally people who take care of sick trauma patients everyday but their St. Patrick’s day boozefest is more important and then I’m stuck being unable to prevent exposure or spread because they don’t care and I still have to show up to work and work next to them. What are all those naval mercy hospital ships up to?  Is it time to think about recalling them? I cant imagine parking a 1000 bed hospital outside of Seattle would be a bad idea right now. Sobering. Thank you. I\"m seeing this more in the context of people who regularly use NSAIDs. There\\'s a lot of talk about stopping them because if you get sick it would make the sickness worse. For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis or something like that. Truly sobering. Under your scenario, every month we prolong the spread is worth up to 8,000 lives. If they willfully infect the entire population then a year\\'s worth of ICU beds goes to waste, and up to 80,000 people die needlessly.  I really wish people would listen to medical professionals when they tell you lifestyle choices are the number one thing you can do to improve and maintain good health. Instead, many people do what they want and then,  when it hits the fan, they want a magic remedy. I hope In the future we spend more time learning and understanding as patients about public health and our responsibilities to care for ourselves. Fox is like crack cocaine. My coworker has been estranged by his son for several years because of it. He told me \"I\\'m addicted to it. I know that. I can\\'t help it\". I thought it so bizarre he said that. Nothing conclusive (obviously, too early) but data from other coronaviruses indicate 2 year (not lifelong) immunity. I\\'m in love with Amy Acton. \"There are most definitely pros and cons to both\"The UK plan will result in thousands of people dying who wouldn\\'t have otherwise.Economic gains will be minimal (If not worse) since the economy isn\\'t just the UK. It\\'s pure Insanity. Stumbled in from the front page. I’m not in the medical field, but this feels so important. I have one meager silver shilling, and you’re getting it kind person. Keep spreading that perspective. It’s massively important in the coming days, weeks, months to not stop spreading this information.I am trying to put myself in the shoes of a healthcare worker, and I know this is something I would need to read too. Love you all, thanks for all you do to keep us safe!  We got this. More so - YOU got this. I’ll do my part in staying home and hope I never have to meet any of you! Ha I did read a theory when this was happening in china that the viral load did influence the severity of illness and they thought this is why young HCWs were becoming seriously ill compared to other young healthy people. Dont know if that has been substantiated, but it makes sense to me. I’m off today but I told my coworkers to print that out and post it everywhere this morning. I don’t know if they did. With the obsession with the stock market and his reported attempt to buy the German company working on a vaccine, there is only a thin veil of pretend leadership hiding the profiteer in chief at this point. Because it looks bad and it\\'s an election year. &gt; It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.The numbers don\\'t really work, though.  There\\'s ~4,000 ICU beds in the UK and the average ventilator time for a Covid-19 patient is around two weeks.  So max they can treat is 8,000 a month or ~80,000 for the remainder of the year.  In a scenario where half the population is infected and 10% need ICU level care that\\'s 3.3 million patients.  So even a perfectly even spread using all available ICU beds, they can treat ~2.4% of the people that need it.  And that\\'s stopping care for everyone else that needs it.  They run around 80% capacity as is, so if we use excess capacity as the number that 2.4% drops to 0.5%.  In a \"everyone gets infected\" scenario we\\'re all pretty fucked and a \"let\\'s get it over with\" plan is probably the best. My spouse is FM (and not on reddit) and is working a COVID tent at a major hospital in a major east coast city. The hospital already has a few dozen covid patients under care.The plan is to use PPE, then come home and  I guess hope for the best. We are both concerned about her contracting and also transmitting to either me or our 6mo son. We have seen anecdotal reports of 10-20% of HCW in Italy contracting, and in this thread about young people (we are both in our 30s) and young doctors essentially dropping dead. Not sure what is real and what isn\\'t.We\\'ve tried to figure out a way for her to quarantine but that is impossible physically as she needs to breast feed our son. Looking for data and experiences of others in similar situations, trying to navigate this. I\\'ll briefly summarize [this interview of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/gesundheit/coronavirus/virologe-hendrik-streeck-ueber-corona-neue-symptome-entdeckt-16681450.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2) broadsheet with Hendrik Streek, head of the virological institute at the University of Bonn, Germany, who has conducted field research on ca. 100 outpatient/home quarantine Covid-19 patients in the Heinsberg District cluster. As soon I see a publication in English, I\\'ll post the link.* 30% of the cases had diarrhea, way higher than in previous reports* Virus RNA found in toilet bowls with no prove of being infectious* A German 15-min rapid test was a failure with a sensitivity of 33% and a specifity of 93%.* A new reported symptom? Loss of smell and tasting.&amp;#8203;    \"Nearly all infected we conducted interviews with - and those were two thirds of all - described a loss of smelling and tasting for multiple days. This went so far that a mother could no longer note the smell of a full diapper of her child. Others could no longer smell their shampoo and food started to taste dull. We cannot say right now when those symptoms start to present but we believe it is at some later point during infection.\" No. There have been isolated reports here and there, but nothing very credible. Seeing as you\\'d need a large population to be re exploded after recovering, and the entire world has less that 7000 recovered people as I write, that\\'s just not possible. This entire tragedy has shined a huge spotlight on America\\'s arrogance. I\\'ve heard so many outrageous responses to taking this seriously that I\\'m already burned out and the worst is still to come.It\\'s like the tide has receded and society is more focused on collecting seashells and IG photos while the tsunami is inevitably about to make landfall.Just this weekend I saw a person, who is a realtor by trade, post that COVID was called an upper respiratory infection in December but the media has now decided to give it a name to incite panic. A realtor posted this theory and it was shared / x-posted and liked by many. https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeonsThis leaves very little wiggle room. Hit me particularly hard I think all you could do is notify Surgical, nursing and hospital leadership regarding the Policy from the American College of Surgeons.https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeonsTheir update leaves little to no wiggle room. What is the rationale for NSAIDs in this disease anyway? Just symptomatic control and anti-pyrexia as usual? I\\'m not sure how avoiding NSAIDs would necessarily be bad per-se. Lowly M-1 who wants to know more.Given the events and measures taken yesterday, have we done enough?  Were we too late?  How much flattening of the curve did we really achieve with shutting the schools in NYC, banning restaurants, etc?What can the general population expect in the coming week-2 weeks? What possibly could be? It it truly just slowing the spread is all we can hope for? Share the hotlines on those posts. People should be calling ahead to get instructions, and yes, that night take a while, but this isn\\'t a fast killer for anyone getting turned back. It takes getting I\\'ll and deteriorating in week 2 to need hospital management, that\\'s all time to call the hotline. Got a link? I don\\'t see anything on google news about this. Large healthcare organizations aren\\'t doing WFH due to organizational inertia and \"it\\'s not in our values\".  How can we expect other companies to do it? Such amazing adviceX thanks for sharing Is it because it wasn\\'t implemented soon enough? my god in heaven what are they waiting for.......i really cant believe it at this point Not enough data. Same as ACEi/ARB. And to be fair the same as all the proposed antiviral treatments - we just don’t have firm evidence yet. Everyone thinks that they\\'re the \"special case\" and that they deserve different care than what is recommended for everyone else.  Sorry you have to deal with this. extremely irresponsible. my quaternary level facility has suspended all elective cases with only urgent procedures being done. the surgeon general and the american college of surgeons has said the same. although, i think it would depend on if there were any COVID positive cases in your area as well.  the ITaly situation showed they went from 1 positive to overwhelmed in the matter of weeks It\\'s hard as hell, but it is important to remember the first step of every layperson CPR algorithm is to make sure the area is safe for you before going in. In this case, that means you absolutely take the time needed to make sure you don all your PPE properly. Multiplying victims helps no one. If your team becomes infected, what happens to the next patient that needs you? And the one after that? This seems like the course that is described for young people. Recovery followed by death from myocarditis. Wage caps at $2M, 1000% luxury goods tax, 100% inheritance tax above $6M, all essential products under government production/control, public service wage caps at $120k and no holding private investments, term limits of two years, ranked choice tele-voting automatic registration, educators paid more than fund managers, ubi, social security at 55, any for profit organizations profit caps at 25%/yr or 100%taxed. Buy me a hotdog, with, with sauerkraut and onions. The alarming thing is that isolation and shutdown are not thought to be enough to stop this. I am tempted to agree that it\\'s not a good idea, but I\\'m not sold completely by the total lockdown Singaporean style approach either. It works in the v short-term, medium and long term you have to be skeptical. Just a note to say I don\\'t think the UK government want infection rates to \"maximise\" in any sense, they want to manage the rate in the \"unlikely to need ICU\" population (How possible that is, I have no idea). Concurrently, I think they do plan on implementing an asian country style \\'lockdown\\' but just for \"likely to need ICU\" population.As stated previously, I\\'m just trying to ascertain the logic here and am not advocating for any particular approach. There are most definitely pros and cons to both. This came up a few times in this megathread over the weekend, but I\\'ve yet to see any evidence either way -- i.e. that it does or does not make a difference. One person over the weekend said that there was a message going around about a study from the University of Vienna (I think? somewhere in Vienna) that suggested that all of the sickest Italian patients had been taking NSAIDs. But the institution in Vienna immediately debunked that. The French health minister was saying this about NSAIDs. And supposedly it had to do with ACE. But everything floating around is hearsay. I don\\'t know, I have a lot of people asking me about it and I have absolutely no information either way. jeeze im crying I agree that if this strategy has any hope of working, our \"Likely to need ICU admission patients\" need to isolate ASAP and this needs to be enforceable by law. At least 20 something states have cancelled school. Im sure yours will happen at some point this week. Governors having FOMO left and right (for good reason!) I would say the lack of foresight is frightening but we don’t need foresight...look at China, Iran and Italy. Why do we seem to think we are above it? I’m at a loss. The schedules for the rest of the week are even busier. Yea a family friend is having surgery this week. She\\'s almost 60 and has CKD, DM, HTN, etc.  Like why the fuck is this happening?! I\\'ve tried repeatedly to tell her daughter to get her reschedule but she thinks the whole thing isn\\'t a big deal so my concerns are falling on deaf ears. I\\'m trying to figure out why the hospital is doing it anyways. Here in the midwest we haven\\'t been hit hard yet but it\\'s coming and we\\'re gonna need all the PPE for emergent surgeries, not elective shit now. It feels so to me. My hospital is the same. The schedule today has elective add ons! It amazes me. Our OR is filled with elective cases today. No one seems to care here or elsewhere. Why are we ignoring this? This is the truth: years of training and experience cannot be replaced by books. Please make sure the knowledge is passed on Are you suggesting COVID was the cause of his arrest? Can someone, anyone, answer me WHY domestic flights have not been grounded yet? Yeah that too.  Information is power, the right information can have big results with minimum expenditure. I only address misinformation if it is dangerous/harmful.  Otherwise people can do whatever they want.  That cuts out most of the work right there. It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.The UK instead is going to maximize the infection rate, overwhelm their health care system quickly, and thereby maximize the amount of casualties. They may shorten the duration of their overall outbreak by a few months, at the price of tens of thousands of lives. Oh that’s terrible. Poor guy. Is this the exact reason patient 31 was such a super spreader? From the salt spraying? It was very brutal. Rip xia And he took out the public health career politician bs and just put a straight doctor in charge of who he listens to. Dr acton My hospital is still allowing a ton of elective surgical cases. Is this as irresponsible as I think it is? I feel like I should refuse to participate in elective cases The NSAID thing is going around Facebook fwiw Do we have a conclusive opinion on the post infection immunity ?And well wishes from Africa. Dismantling the NIH pandemic response office should be criminal with these results. Lives are and will be lost,  not even mentioning economic impacts. Leadership should be held accountable by the people but it seems like we are too far gone for that in this country. I think this is what they are going for as well.I am extremely skeptical for multiple reasons. Firstly, the virus has proven itself extremely contagious. They are not currently doing anything to prevent its spread, and elderly people are not forced into self isolation. So...it\\'s spreading like wildfire right now through every age group. Personally I feel this will overwhelm the NHS within 2-3 weeks.They\\'re also playing a dangerous game with trying to infect the \"healthy\" people as that will still come at a cost - 25 year olds still die of Covid-19. They are less likely to die, but doesn\\'t change the fact that they are certainly sacrificing lives for this \"herd immunity.\"I am also skeptical of herd immunity. Is there any evidence that you even develop immunity to this virus? There have been multiple reports of people who have been positive, then get better and are negative, becoming positive again.  Plus it seems that just like influenza it would be easy for a slightly different strain to come around and make though thousands to hundreds of thousands of people you let die for her immunity utterly pointless.Another interesting thought I saw brought up is that since most other countries are going for the total lockdown eradication route, does this not mean they will have to stop all travel to and from the UK for the foreseeable future? Our current plan is let everyone get infected. If the plan continues for a year, which they think it will, surely that means any country that has stopped the virus via isolation would not allow someone from a country letting it run free come in.Overall, I see why they are trying to mitigate economic effects. I just can\\'t get behind the plan, and I do not see the NHS coping for very long. Well, not all countries have factories making ppe under their command.Now my Utopia on Earth has a strong advanced Heath system and manufacture everything so no imports. Anyone would like to add to my Utopia ? We all need this reminder.  Thank you. Thank you for this. It becomes very concerning when all over the US, we are running out of PPE very quickly. We may get more in the long term but in the short term, the decisions are even more difficult right access to proper PPE. So CDC is recommending no gatherings of 50+ people, yet schools do not count. Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown? Cases are increasing rapidly yet we\\'re pussy footing around and letting people do whatever they want to a large degree. It\\'s so frustrating that we\\'ve seen the results of dragging feet from China and Italy and think we will magically not have the same outcomes. &gt; What has happened to America?It was made great.I know we prefer shying away from politics, but this fish rotted from the head from day 1. My wife is going through the same thing.Very disheartening to her when the people who brag about her to their friends, completely ignore the topic they brag about. Guess what news channel is on 24/7?We\\'re going to try one more time tonight. We\\'re hoping we can spin it as we need them to set an example for those around because this is a dangerous situation for my wife. &gt;I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.Wait, what?*Clicks link*...Oh. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infectionThis article states that NSAIDS are supposedly worsening the symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Is there any pathophysiological understanding of why that is? Typically NSAIDS can cause damage to the GI system or renal system, how can it worsen respiratory symptoms? I have been very intrigued by the seemingly slow UK response and the reasons behind it. Having had a think, I think the reason may be about finding a compromise between the health and financial impacts of the pandemic: If non vulnerable people contract the virus (20-50 year olds, no comorbidities) they are unlikely to need ICU admission. Therefore we are not v worried about them getting it. In fact, we want them to get it at a steady rate so we can get them back to being fully fledged members of the economy: working, purchasing etc. They get the virus, they self-isolate for a period and then ideally behave normally. This will be facilitated by widespread rapid home-testing kits, production of which is being accelerated as we speak. Meanwhile we hide away the vulnerable (this group will be defined further in the next few days ie not just over 70s) as they are the ICU admission risk. They are locked away until the Ro drops below one due to the development of \"herd immunity\". I believe the economic risk is the reason for the aversion to a \"lockdown\" type strategy, not negligence.Any thoughts? Agreements/Disagreements?I don\\'t think this is necessarily the correct response but I think its what they are going for. My shop began creating cohort units yesterday. ICU, stepdown, med/surg. Shit\\'s getting real now.Facebook meme status report: less \"it\\'s just flu\" and more \"kids staying at home is the end of my life\". St. Florence Nightingale posting remains hot. Toilet paper memes growing tired and losing value, but still pushed hard by Facebook neophytes. Our government has called for a voluntary ban on gatherings that church services would fit into. However, I think there would be a literal armed revolt if the government tried to actually ban church services. Interesting video about what Nanjing has done to stop the spread:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsdJGj3-jMBiggest things I see are temperature check points everywhere, masks everywhere, and lots of little sensible things like tissue to touch the elevator buttons and not allowing face to face seating at restaurants.  I\\'m also sure it will warm everyone\\'s heart to see that fast food workers in China have better PPE than medical workers here. So what\\'s the deal with NSAIDs?  Good, Bad, Not enough data? Or spending $0.00 to make an announcement directing people to isolate themselves. # Current Covid-19 stats:  * Total reported cases: 173,833  * Total reported deaths: 6,680 * Total reported recoveries: 77,826 * Estimated death rate: 3.84 u/Number_Bot !Coronavirus Christ, that was brutal. not 2T into masks and ventilators, mind you I honestly don\\'t understand people sometimes.  There is a TON of information out there that unless if you are incredibly sick, don\\'t come in to the ED just to see if you have coronavirus.  Even if you have a known exposure, if your symptoms are mild, you are to call either the state hotline or the hotlines set up by the major health systems near me.  But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.  For one of them, my nurse basically asked them if they thought it was a good idea to come in and expose all of us if they did have it, or if they should just call the hotline like is recommended.  They basically said they didn\\'t know if the hotline open during the middle of the night... hopefully your husband\\'s boss is pressured to implement WFH, and soon This is so infuriating. You are so correct about our need for meaningful code discussions ahead of time. I’ll have to look on SHM if they have recommendations but it may be something for rounders to discuss daily. Thanks for the response. Stay safe! This post is for my healthcare workers, docs, surgeons, Nurses, aids, and ems, but also support staff.There is no emergency in a pandemicYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you\\'re going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You\\'re going to have to put your needs first.I\\'m speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.If you\\'re an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed)But your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves.You stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.You going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any  patients in the weeks your laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.People are going to die. Do not become one of them. There is no emergency in a pandemic.During the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter, before going in. If we didn\\'t have proper PPE we did NOT go in.There is no emergency in a pandemic.You may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPEThere is no emergency in a pandemic.You may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.There is no emergency in a pandemic.You may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.There is no emergency in a pandemic.A self qaurentined patient has a gun shot wound and is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPEThere is no emergency in a pandemic Many of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn\\'t be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient. Liberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.Then they became infected, they infected others. And they died.  They didn\\'t help anyone after that.Do not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten. I live in Ohio. I’m not a fan of Mike DeWine, but he has been excellent thus far. Leading the way in shutting down sporting events, schools, restaurants, and bars. I expect a complete state shutdown in the next day or two. Everything he has done has been backed by his head of the Ohio Department of Health. The federal government has sucked. Some state governments are doing a good job. When I used to counsel and people would bring these things up, I would encourage them to really do their own in depth research into it... really look into who is \"conducting\" the research and who is \"publishing\" the info- oftentimes it is the company themselves or a company they\\'re paying so there\\'s a financial incentive to make things look good- that line sometimes gets some people thinking. Bringing up the fact that there\\'s no one actually vetting the product and some studies have shown that many supplements dont actually contain the amount they claim on the bottle occasionally helps (not as much as you would think). Explaining that treatment plans are very tailored to the individual and these people dont actually set what\\'s going on with the pt or what they\\'re taking may interact/cause side effects with their meds or disease state may also rope some people.  Things that hit home are when you can relate the situation to something the patient can understand. One of my faves is, \"would you turn to an accountant (or your Aunt Jane) to give you advice on how to fix your car? No, so why take the chance with your body?\" In the case of Dr. Oz, \"how comfortable would you feel asking a heart surgeon to operate on your brain?\" (or something related to the patient\\'s field of work- \"Would you ask the guy who only does oil changes on passenger cars to fix your big rig?\"). Yikes. Only consolidation I can offer is there\\'s about a 98% chance that flight will not be permitted come Saturday. That’s rough.  Code discussions with patients have never been so important.Crash carts around suspected should have PPE in their IMHO.Italy intubates early, as they have seen a fairly predictable pattern of aggressive crumping after a few days of illness You have to allow people a little leeway to engage in bullshit. These are stressful times and people will often double down on vices to manage that stress. If homeopathic bullshit is their jam then they’ll probably look to that. I think the main question is whether the horse shit treatment is harmful or not. For example if someone is taking high levels of an herb/mineral/etc that can cause other health problems to arise, or if they are not taking proper precautions and exposing themselves to risky situations because they think they are immune or whatever. The bottom line is to stress the fact that we know very little about this virus and there is no currently recognized cure(homeopathic or otherwise) and that all of us still need to practice proper sanitation and social distancing. Bars were packed on Saturday night in Boston despite everyone being urged to self-isolate. Now our governor has issued restrictions limiting restaurants and bars to take-out orders only. I fear it\\'s already too late. Gatherings are now limited to 25 people, but my husband still has to go to work in an engineering office with a lot more people than that. Everything is confusion. Have any experts discussed how in the future we can determine how long the social distancing measures and other efforts need to last? Right now we probably can\\'t know how long this needs to go on because we don\\'t know exactly how it\\'s going to spread, but as the weeks and months roll by how can we determine that we have effectively flattened the curve and we can start going back to business as usual?What sort of measures will they be looking at - total number of current and resolved cases? Daisychaining of ventilators in Vegas during the shooting - 8 patients per vent.

I’ve barely worked at the place a year but the more senior nurses have quit and I’m known as a smarty-pants who they will look to for guidance.Facility is a 23 hr institution so only day chairs for napping, no beds, communal bathrooms and showers. Barely any PPE. No true isolation rooms whatsoever. Patients are usually two to a room so the best we could do is keep 1 patient to a room at a time... but there’s only 8 rooms. Max capacity is 17 for the entire unit.We get patients who are walk-ins, police drop-offs from the community, and referrals from hospitals. Leadership is struggling to find the right balance of staff safety, patient safety, and infection prevention. Our population and frequent flyers include a lot of older homeless people with chronic coughs. (Fuck.)I have suggested the following:Patients cleared by the hospital must present as afebrile and cough, if present, must be infrequent and the patient needs to be coherent enough to know to cover with his elbow and follow up with hand washing.Patients from the community (including police drop-offs) may enter through the back constables office where we have a separate shower. The patient will be checked for fever and cough; if cleared by nursing, the patient must immediately shower and change into our paper scrubs. Temperatures are checked twice each shift on EVERYONE.The problem we run into is that our population is not always compliant. Already, we had a schizophrenic from home enter in a catatonic state whose arms/legs were rigid and we couldn’t change him into scrubs, let alone shower him. Then he tried to run out the door and needed a B52 so then we got to keep him, yay.Thoughts? Advice? Help. What’s the safest I can keep my psych cuties and my co-workers? LOL What do you mean done nothing? They cut the short interest rate to zero and injected $2T into the markets. /s Seeing posts shared on the lovely Facebook about people trying to get tested in the US and being turned away with a giant hospital bill. I know people here were discussing that this whole thing should increase the population’s trust in the medical system but I’m worried that’s going to completely backfire. Heard about a 35 year old  intensivist dying in Indianapolis yesterday with OOHCA after his shift caring for multiple critically ill patients. Thoughts are with his family and colleagues. I’ve spent way too much of my time over the last several days fighting misinformation among my friends on Facebook (I even reactivated my account to do it). I don’t have a canned response but I’m just trying to calmly point out inaccuracies and include links. I’ve even included some journal links when it seemed appropriate, rather than press or things written for lay readers. IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. But the people who just dabble in whatever they hear about are often happy right now to hear from a doctor who knows what they’re saying. I try to stick only to facts but I do get asked advice and I only give with a lot of caveats and also I keep saying the facts are the best I have but some might be wrong and I’ll update if they are. It’s a complicated line between seeming expert enough for people to take me seriously and making sure I don’t say anything that isn’t true or good advice. I was wondering this as well Question. Attended my first RRT for a patient under precautions with test results pending that night (came back positive today). Severe respiratory distress that happened extremely fast as we waited way too long for PPE. How is everyone stocking crash carts and RSI kits? Our N-95 stock is under lock and key with the house supervisor so no masks were present and PAPR was not on floor. Initially called a code and I cannot imagine if they were truly in cardiac arrest because it took 5+ minutes to get the bare minimum of PPE. It was honestly shocking how fast they went downhill and I never want to be staring at someone threw a window going into that level of distress and anxiety again and not be able to do something because PPE isn’t readily available. I’m trying my best to fight misinformation in my social media circle. Breaking down medical stuff for the layperson in a calm, polite way is my jam. However, when I encounter folks advocating or inquiring about Goop/Dr. Oz “remedies” like essential oils, I struggle.  Obviously, telling these folks that their remedy is horseshit would likely lead to them doubling down on said horseshit.    Does anyone have any good ideas for this situation? Would love to put together a canned response I can tweak as needed. (I know I probably won’t change these people’s minds, but would like a measured response that won’t inflame them, and would leave the door open to further education.) That picture of Magic Kingdom last night is deeply unsettling. The airport photos concerned me but those people were mostly stuck unwittingly. The fact that so many people chose to go to Magic Kingdom, though . . . Is that really from last night? they still basically have not done jack shit up to this point I don’t work in the medical field but my brother is an ER doctor(hasn’t seen any COVID19 cases yet to the best of my knowledge), but these reports of ER doctors falling critically ill has me worried. Is the reason why these doctors fell critically ill just the luck of the draw from contracting the virus itself? Or are medical workers at a higher risk for severe cases because they may be exposed to heavier viral loads if they are around lots of people with the virus all day? I saw someone suggesting the latter on a tv show I watched about the doctor in Wuhan who sounded the alarm and then died(he was only in his 30s). Though I have some suspicions that his real cause of death may be the Chinese communist party. If your country hasn\\'t yet banned gatherings of people in the dozens, especially churches, make sure they do!Here in South Korea we\\'re starting to get over the SCJ cult cluster but now we have multiple small clusters linked to churches. One church sprayed salt water into the mouths of attendees in the belief that it would kill the virus. Of course people coughed onto the nozzle when the salt water hit their tonsils and there are now 40+ cases linked to that church/facepalm This is why the government has to step in and force shit to be shut down. A considerable portion of the population will ignore the warnings and recommendations, and in a situation like this you really need full compliance. I started wondering this last night myself. Came across this [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html?fbclid=IwAR3cjqojQTsW4wPmETYoNkywPuNXSUDNXy5ronkb9nouuV165RNoJbZRhYE) profiling two 29 year old HCWs from China- one doctor and one nurse- and their trajectory after being diagnosed. It\\'s a sobering reminder that although some of us may not fall into higher risk categories,  it\\'s still important to protect ourselves as much as possible in the coming days. I saw a great quote this week that summed up this feeling for me “a week ago, no one had heard of coronavirus or an epidemiologist and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiology.” It’s on both extremes, panickers and deniers couldn’t care that you might actually know something factual as an MD. I need to rant. My wife is being induced tomorrow. Her parents are still planning to go to Cabo on Saturday. I’ve told them virus danger, bringing it to their elderly parents, border lockdown (turning 1 week into 3+) and also how they aren’t to see us for 2 weeks after being on US soil. Totally unfazed. Usual boomer responses- it’s the flu, I feel fine, I’ve lost enough money in the market don’t wanna lose the trip, and the more infuriating ‘you work in a hospital, i think that’s more dangerous’. I’m so beyond pissed. I’m pissed that MDs have lost their authority in this country. Any idiot can put whatever they want on FB, do whatever they want with their bodies and it’s all ok. Question concerning surfactant application:  As far as I know surfactant has proven ineffective in \"usual\" adult septic ARDS due to the complexity of the problem. However I just read that sars-coV-2 attacks the surfactant producing type 2 pneumocytes. Considering the fast pacing collapse of alveolae wouldn\\'t a (possibly repeated) application of surfactant aerosol help keeping them open?   Does anybody know wether this is being reevaluated?

It\\'s obviously not recommended practice and ideally things further upstream would prevent this necessity, but might be worth your time now so that you can muse over it before you\\'re in the situation where you\\'d even be considering it. The short version is to use CMV pressure cycled mode; tidal volume isn\\'t controllable but peak pressures are. Opiates may help suppress respiratory drive to prevent contagious tachypnoea if you can\\'t set a trigger lockout. There\\'s obviously a lot of deadspace issues and tracking tidal volumes in real time will be difficult.* The UK\\'s RCoA, FICM, ICS, and AAGBI have partnered together to produce a [website full of resources](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/) and guidance. The [clinical guidance section](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/clinical-guidance) is worth bookmarking on your phone; this website is being continuously updated as further evidence and recommendations become available.* There\\'s a nice visual representation of the history of pandemic from the World Economic Forum [here](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/a-visual-history-of-pandemics).* Globally, the number of infections and deaths outside of China has [overtaken](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655bc7db923ab22f97c5afa2c84c33cfdd1437a6/0_26_482_289/master/482.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fa66f7b0028ef967d550645abebd1dad) those inside China [for the first time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-global-deaths-and-infections-overtake-those-inside-china).

The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”&gt; The document also states that:&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.This isn\\'t necessarily the most likely scenario, but it\\'s rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.* I think it\\'s pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don\\'t want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn\\'t really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I\\'ve also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.* Jack Ma, co-founder of China\\'s enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s). Yes, things are bad enough in the USA, that poor, underdeveloped, and disadvantaged country that had absolutely no forewarning about an imminent pandemic /s, that Chinese philanthropists are donating vast quantities of relief supplies. *What has happened to America?** We\\'re hearing [confirmation](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-confirms-that-donald-trump-tried-to-buy-firm-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine/) from Germany that Trump tried to [buy exclusive American](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html) access to a vaccine; things got a bit heated and there seems to be more going on [under the surface](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal):&gt; Last week, the firm mysteriously announced that CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella had been replaced by Ingmar Hoerr, just weeks after Menichella met Trump, his vice-president Mike Pence and representatives of pharma companies in Washington.The German interior crisis committee will be discussing this urgently today and we\\'ll see what they have to say.* Baltimore has a great public health campaign about social distancing [here](https://twitter.com/AlecMacGillis/status/1239360166350532608). We need similarly impactful messaging globally ASAP.* Australia is [running short](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent) of PCR reagent just as it seems to be reaching an exponential inflection point:&gt; The Australian Medical Association has warned a common reagent that is critical in the testing of coronavirus is facing supply issues because of the huge demand on Australian laboratories due to Covid-19.South Australia has a small stockpile which may need to be carefully redistributed.* New York governor Andrew Cuomo has written an [opinion piece in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-trump.html) urging more drastic action, including use of active duty military personnel to aid in expanding hospital capacity - in echoes of what China did.* Leaving on a lighter note, here\\'s a [message of hope](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1239383795205169152) from Arnold Schwarzenegger.

      "Hanging in there, thanks! Hope you are well. Main tank died, do we have any battle rez left? I concur. Elbow bumps from Stockholm, Sweden. Stay safe and take care! It's been a week since this comment. So much has changed in that week that I want to ask, how are you doing? Are you hanging in there? Now it looks like the US is tanking :/ Doesn’t matter if you burst through the wall like the koolaid man to save a battered wife in a domestic violence incident, if you aren’t paying attention and she stabs you in the neck with a kitchen knife (which actually happens a whole lot. Violent dysfunctional couples are weird...) Absolutely agree on the feelings but that’s totally the point. Best life lesson I’ve learned in my (non medical) career is “if you feel the need to rush, slow down and back up”. It’s what saves you from mistakes, especially when stakes are high. And it’s easier when it’s constant, in a weird way. When you have one memorable event a week or day its easy to feel like you have to rush in and fix everything. When it’s a shitstorm when you show up and you know it’ll still be a shitstorm when you leave, you show up, put on your gear, and follow the damn procedures. As an ER medic in an almost no resource environment, thank you. [deleted] Those would definitely be very much needed for these patients. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is the feared complication of COVID-19, and needs specific parameters for ventilation. If you want numbers the protocol is called ARDS-NET. Yes, 100% oxygen would be a huge issue. The hospital oxygen sources I've seen are all flow restrictive as opposed to pressure regulators, so that wouldn't work for this.  Plus you'd be ventilating your patients with 100% oxygen without a compressed air source, risking oxygen toxicity.Sorry typo: meant once per 4-6 seconds, not 4-6 times per second.  We had a call with a respiratory therapist yesterday evening who said being able to tweak the rate and limit the compression of the ambubag would be his primary concerns. No, most rooms in a hospital have an oxygen hookup. 4-6 times *a second?!* Where are you reading this?! Also PMing you my work email so I can respond quicker Thanks!    From what I've been able to gather, positive pressure/compressed air/medical air is generally only available in ORs, correct?  Another idea I've been looking into is trying to automate an ambu bag/bag valve mask.  I've got a prototype built where I cannibalized parts from our intermitting suction regulators to be able to drive a piston up and down to compress an ambubag in the 4-6 times per second range the internet says is standard.  What concerns might you have with this concept? ICU RN here, I just want to say thank you for this. I'm going to  share this with my co-workers and RN friends. What you said is so significant and profound; I have found some comfort in your words, thank you truly. Powerful reminder If you have questions after reading the link someone else provided, let me know. Would be happy to discuss with you. You could make 'em last a bit longer by wearing a surgical mask over your N95... if you have them. No nebs.What are you guys doing with regards to intubation? Do you have PPE? they started it That's what I was trying to say. Didn't realize this would have started a whole chain of comments/arguments *(I was thinking of the annoucement headline from the Telegraph: \"Boris Johnson shutdowns UK\" - of course, that's not technically correct either)*I'll correct my comment. don't encourage homicide unfortunately good information isn't contagious I’d climb a mountain of bodies to make it to the polls this year, COVID virus or not. &gt;  Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union.They're bluffing and we need to call their bluff. Things are only going to keep getting worse until ordinary people organise better and yes risk their jobs to stand up for better treatment.Also please vote... I'm not telling you who to vote for, just vote. You misunderstand. He's not *reading* the book, he's trying to *write* the book. I never said the argument for unions was anything but strong; I agree with you about that. My point is that you put your job in serious risk if you attempt to organize your workplace. If you don’t have a 100% perfect record with attendance, zero customer complaints, perfect reviews, etc., then you can 100% count on getting fired or finding your hours cut to 3 a week if you’re part time. And lots of employers aren’t above faking bad reviews or attendance records.  A general strike will only result in millions of terminations. Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union. That's like asking someone how he knows what the weather is without being a meteorologist. Actually, it's worse: it's questioning how someone can know what a book says without being an expert, when all that is required is literacy. Right... so again you're just making the argument for unions stronger.    Since the 1980s when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers there has been a continuous effort to reduce the power of unions and make them irrelevant chipping away at them bit by bit.  We need something like a general strike to get laws on unions changed. See all those people out there in the public with masks? Yuppers. And since we are low on PPE when we are out we go home.... Of course it’s illegal to fire someone for trying to organize. They’ll either find some other way to get rid of you (cutting hours, putting you on the graveyard shift, giving you an impossible workload that will inevitably lead to failure, transfer to their Alaska HQ, etc) or they’ll just fire you as an example to the other workers of what happens when you try to organize.  They’ll consider any fines to be money well spent, if it keeps a union out of their workplace.Edit:  they can and will fire as many people as possible to prevent organization.  If I means shutting down for a week while new workers are hired, so be it.  They’ll do anything and everything necessary to keep a union out, even if it means closing a location. Again this is why we need unions.  If enough people support a union they can't fire everyone.  Anyway depending on which state of the USA it's illegal for them to fire you for discussing a union with your colleagues. You need to be careful, though. In the USA your employer will usually fire you for even contemplating the concept of a union if they find out, if you’re not already covered by one. And if you *do* manage to organize your co-workers, they’ll just shut down your site, like Walmart did/does. ... at which point they will entirely un-ironically shout \"you should've warned us this would happen!\" Probably also \"you should've been more prepared!\"Well, you did, and you tried as best as they'd let you. I'm not sure about full recovery, but at least enough for a hospital to discharge them. Yeah you know this is exactly why unions exist and need to exist.  Support the unions in your industry! The mask is literally my only protection... 30mg is equivalent to about 650mg acetaminophen IIRC. But it's better for pain as far as I know. mdi with spacer is the correct answer. This is horrifying. Thank you for the summary im just basing it off of stories of people being re-infected being very rare, despite the chances of you getting it twice is probably pretty high. If you think about how many tests have been taken, its likely that they weren't all perfect, therefore the people who are allegedly getting it twice are probably just people who had inaccurate tests the first time or something like that. If you could get it again I reckon it would be common knowledge by now idk. Take all the data you see with a pinch of salt, this is the internet Please don't re-write history here. China did not let WHO or other agencies come in until it was MUCH later. They blocked their own scientists and doctors from speaking up early on which led to the spread of this virus. They are not a shining example of anything. In addition, I'm not sure anyone believes that their numbers were as low as reported. It wouldn't surprise me if it was actually in the millions. Do you really believe that not a single Chinese military member got infected? That being said, of course we will study this after the fact and find the best practices from each country. Let's see how how we handle this surge in our ICU's - and what effect the current restrictions have - before we judge ourselves as failures. Or is it anti retro viral use? And if we count in how many people are going to die as a consequence of that economic fallout, how many suicides, broken marriages etc...Both strategies have a bad ending and it is not clear which ending is worse. Hi all,Paramedic from Australia here.Just looking for some advice/ideas on the risks involved with prehospital management of infective exacerbation of COPD. A mainstay of our prehospital care of exacerbation of COPD is salbutamol/ipratropium bromide nebs. Obviously this is now a high risk procedure going forward, any recommendations in change of practice? PMDI use with spacers seems to be the logical decision for prehospital management however at this time our service is limited to salbutamol. Any other ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Stay safe out there! &gt; because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.Why would that be? The clinical significance and direction of the upregulated ACE2 is still ???. There's mouse studies suggesting ACE2 is protective vs acute lung injury. Just want to clarify the 260k deaths is real bad but the real problem is the peak ICU demand 8x of surge capacity The us could accomplish many o the same things but had chosen not to  This will be a crazy case study with chapters upon chapters upon chapters on how we screwed up from not letting the WHO help US, not listening to medical professionals and experts, and just...its frustrating. Not to mention that the people’s mindset in the US vs countries like China are different. The US is more of a .....individualistic look out for myself type mindset?  I’m curious to see where this lockdown will lead Then they’ll just whine about PPE not being available when called on it.  Meanwhile, they don’t give a damn about their workers, and their lawyers can beat up your lawyers. Hi all!This is somewhat self-promotion, but it's for a good cause and we need medical volunteers so I thought I'd post it anyway.  I built a website that allows people who want to volunteer/work to fight coronavirus connect with those that need help, be they hospitals, research labs, or even households. People sign up, and, in a couple of days, those that need volunteers can put in their location and we will provide them with a list of people nearby. Anyone in the US can sign up. If you are interested in helping, please volunteer, upvote or share. Website:  [https://endcovid.org/volunteers/](https://endcovid.org/volunteers/) I think we already realize that, while China's response is impressive. We can't replicate it, China is another beast. Most of the essential resources to implement their plan is already at their disposable or they are able to make them.I think it's ironic that the things that make us describe China as a dystopia. Are things that helped them control the outbreaks. From their Extensive Mass Surveillance System, being the factory's of the world, asia's collective culture in general, to the gov complete authority over the people.They built a hospital in 7 days, were able to manufacture whatever they need from PPE to Ventilators, according to the WHO's mission CT scan is done in 10 mins.CCP realized what needs to be done and had the power and resources to do it.I hate to admit it but we have to acknowledge China's points of strength.And I hope that we learn from their strength in the future.However, I think that we should look into Singapore and South Korea's Response.Both are Democracies who are successful in limiting the spread. I also think that it's likely that China will have a second wave but it will be ready for it or maybe be able to prevent it till a vaccine is available. This comment brought the scene in saving Private Ryan to my mind, where they are Omaha and talking about leaving people to move onto someone you can actually save. I'm curious about everyone's thoughts on the information surrounding avoiding ibuprofen. I'm getting questions from patients and the only reputable mention of it I've found is in this Lancet article, which only briefly mentions it in the setting of potentially increasing ACE2: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltextI'm hesitant to base recommendations on laboratory studies but ....? Toradol hasn’t been shown to be a great antipyretic After briefly getting tests back in 3 days, we're back out to 5+ days and we've been told to cut access to testing to only health care workers and people in the hospital. Sounds like there's a shortage on reagents to me reading between the lines of some things said to me. You're being downvoted, but you are technically correct.This is the quote from above&gt;  the UK has shutdown yesterday.The technically correct quote should be&gt; the UK has start to shutdown yesterday Assuming country x somehow prevent infection spread completely. As most ppl stays at home with limited contact to others for more than 14 days ( while 80% of the infected develop Immunity and 20% are treated ).Won't that stop the spread till a case is imported or infection reemerge, repeating the same circle.Just to be clear I'm not criticizing any measures taken to minimize the death toll. Hmm, no. Looks like they are afraid it might cause too much fear. &amp;#x200B;Anyway, it shows about 40 or so patients in large rooms with only 1 staff in sight. Patients desaturating, patients semi-unconscious on NRB, patients almost falling out of gourneys. It is one of the saddest things I have seen. &amp;#x200B;Anyway point was quality of care appears to have really taken a hit with the staffing issues. A year from now, I think we're going to look back at China and realize they were a special case.Because of China's authoritarian rule, they had the ability (and even the political will-power) to enforce stick lockdowns and ensure this passed relatively quickly.Western countries will not see the same lockdown response. I'd personally expect this to pan out for a lot longer time in western countries. Supposedly they can be reused up to 5 times with the limit being obvious contamination (wet with moisture from ones own breath or body fluid splash), which ever comes first.With the supply chain issues I guess there is no alternative And special needs students who not only aren't getting school but aren't getting PT, OT, or speech therapist. I have a 3 year old in school who has been doing phenomenally since she started and I'm worried that all of her gains will be lost. We can afford to bring people into our house to do it privately for a little while but I'm not even sure that's a good idea. Slow down the system. Stop new infections Has there been any case report of COVID-19 in HIV patients ?I think it may Provide insight on the role of immune response and the cytokine storm theory. Let’s put it this way, as a general rule people and animals will develop immunity to a virus after being infected with it. This is how most viruses work, in particular it’s also how most coronaviruses work. There really is no evidence that this virus is an exception to that rule, and if it was then it would make this virus exceptionally unique. A few anecdotal reports that could easily be explained by a flare up or prolonged infection shouldn’t cause us to toss everything we know about viruses out the window. The bigger concern is that there is some evidence of people being contagious after symptoms have subsided. I am far more worried about people who had the virus spreading it to others after their symptoms are gone than the possibility of this virus being an enigma that causes reinfection. Slow it so the system can handle it. China almost certainly hasn't eliminated it. Word I'm not sure if my question make sense, When a country shut down, is their goal to slow down the infection to a spread the health system can accommodate. Or are they aiming for China, elimination of the infection till a vaccine is made ? Based on the fact that almost every virus works like that and there really is no evidence that this virus is an exception. Shot by someone who didn't? Good bot Is nonfunctional ppe even considered ppe at that point? Why the devil would you shave... what madness was this? So far the hospital has burned through over 70% of this years entire supply of masks in the last two weeks but we only have one confirmed case and two possibles that are still awaiting testing. My OR has decided to hoard all the N95 masks they could find or acquire, while also punishing people for wearing them while in the OR and attempting to prevent other units from stealing equipment. Anesthesia isn’t very happy with this as they aren’t comfortable working with patients doing even non aerosol generating procedures with the current level of equipment available. It’s business as usual until we get a local outbreak event but there’s a soft limit to adding non-emergent cases. Also several people have come back from cruises and or trips over the weekend but were tested. One of our people who was working cases was tested on the cruise and shown negative but is back to work with what appears to be “allergies”.  Another who recently returned from Seattle was hanging out in the lounge even though they were off and was also displaying some “allergy” like symptoms. Preop is doing patient screening and visitor limits. Honestly I feel like we’re fucked because nobody is taking any of this seriously, the vast majority of my coworkers have either completely ignored what’s going on as propaganda or just downplayed this as another flu. I get we tend to have blinders on because draining fingers and C-sections are more important but I’m not very confident with how we are approaching things. Considering we live in a fairly large city with a large population of elderly or those considered at risk, when it does kick off we’re going to get slammed. Unfortunately that isn’t an option &gt;  I think you do get immune to itBased on what facts are you saying this? I'm not arguing with you, but I'm reading so much anecdotal data... That's not really helping. I'm not an expert but there are very few reports of reinfection, most of them seem to be anecdotal or a result of inaccurate testing before. I believe in herd immunity. Makes more sense than in China, where they're just gonna get rid of quarantines just for everyone to get re-infected No! The whole point of this post is to *minimize* exposure! In the US &gt; I assume la Repubblica is a reliable news source? Yeah, no reason to think this would be faked by the paper/journalist. Hopefully there'll be real analysis on this soon. Thank you. I fully understand all of the above already. I was merely clarifying for the sake of avoiding misinformation that the uk has not shut down yesterday, as stated before. Thank you for all of your information regardless. Like I said, the process has started and is being phased in over the next days/week. So far they have removed emergency personnel from large gatherings, which makes them impossible to insure and therefore impossible to hold. Recommendations on social distancing have been implemented. Right now attending restaurants, clubs, shopping centres is not recommended but not enforced - they want people to comply willingly. But once the UK's caseload reaches the appropriate number, compliance will be enforced. I said the UK hasn’t been shut down yesterday, because it hasn’t. Restaurants, clubs, schools, transport, shopping centres and everything still open. I don’t understand how this constitutes shutting down. Do you know of another source for this video, it's blocked now Yes it has. We were initially following a mitigation strategy, but following a recent report from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College London we've switched to a suppression strategy (i.e. close it all down). That's not happening instantly, it's being phased in over days. I know that in the hospital I work at (CA) the adult side has run out of swabs and we're dangerously low on reagent. Not that we have any test kits anyways so the swabs were sent to Quest and are just sitting there... If test numbers are being obscured with for that reason, do you think retroactively accurate numbers are likely to emerge once the economy has stabilized?  Or never? No it hasn’t?? first step will be 24h and then continue for a regular shift - so 32h. but i expect to go back to weekend shifts, i.e. 48h, our *regular* workload means i usually get to sleep 4-6h/shift. Yes but I'm still unclear, is there an emergency during a pandemic? Can anyone point me to some references regarding immunity after COVID-19? My country has decided to go with the group immunity strategy and frankly I feel a bit anxious; I was under the impression it is not clear at all how immunity works with this virus? The UK has walked back the \"herd immunity\" thing - claiming it was misinterpreted by the media. In any case, the UK has shutdown yesterday. I want so much to direct some nursing colleagues here. I’m afraid, based on their social media, that they would “brigade.” I cause enough trouble without calling in the “it’s just a flu” nurses. Stand by it! My stupid ass sister has  been partying it up in NOLA. I won’t see her until his is ALL over. She can’t be trusted. Period. Symptoms of viral infections(not all) are due to body's immunological response. Glucocorticoids are used in treatment of symptoms of viral infections, f.ex. hemorrhaging fevers. Children have a weaker immune system then adults and they not affected.So in theory to temporarily moderate immunological response in severely affected patients could mild but prolong the symptoms. Any professionals have an analysis about what is going on in Japan? It seems like we are running the same “herd immunity” strategy as the UK. I know this may be their strategy to flatten the curve in hopes the Olympics start on schedule but it’s causing people to get restless and ready to get back to normal since the daily numbers are so low. Testing though is low it seems. If I ever build a house I’ll have an attached garage with a laundry room with a shower stall between the house and garage. Or a shower in the garage. Watch these become HGTV features. They’ll call them “Physician Passthroughs” or something. This is not a bad idea. Broken hips and hot spots out to sea. Plus, aren’t there supplies in these ships that could be used? Surely they’re not using “just in time” inventorying. Drop Kick Murphy is live streaming their audience free St Pats show. Please encourage everyone to stay home and watch that ALONE. Your coworkers should be ashamed. And publicly shamed. Ive seen too many nurses saying really stupid shit! Including four nurses and a nursing student that stayed in NOLA until the cops came around to close up shop! It’s gonna be real bad real soon. Also important to note, as the UK report states, China's draconian measures only work so long as they are enforced. As soon as the restrictions are lifted, the virus will resume it's growth.Wuhan will have slightly lower transmission rates since some now have immunity, but I believe the number of recovered cases is still very low relative to the city's population, so it likely won't have much of an effect. There are laws to report whistleblowers. I am not familiar enough to say if they protect you for going to the media or just to a regulatory body. I am not currently working and would be happy to research that for you tomorrow if you drop me a PM with your state. That policy is bullshit, unfortunately Are you a med pro!? Can you get off reddit and contribute to the pandemic plz? &amp;#x200B;The detachment is unreal. There are already 2 US ER docs in critical care. Well get updated numbers tomorrow. That’s been the pattern in IL as far as I can tell. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent&gt; The department of health said there was currently significant pressure on stocks of all consumables used by laboratories.But it voiced particular concern about RNA extraction.“Due to global demand exceeding supply, stocks of all laboratory related testing consumables are under considerable strain,” a spokeswoman said.“At the moment there are particular concerns around supplies of swabs and DNA extraction kits.”https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-chief-warns-of-supply-pressure-on-reagents-for-coronavirus-tests/573999/&gt; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Wednesday told a House appropriations subcommittee that the agency is “aware of pressure in the supply system on the reagents” needed to run diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus. Specifically, Hahn said “there are pressures particularly around RNA” required for COVID-19 testing. Got me ;-) No parties around anymore due to friggin corona... so I gotta tell Reddit ;-) Stay safe! Removed due to Rule 4 After you had exposure to COVID19 without PPE. Also called quarantine. So... Dont' drive faster than Mach 1? ;) Pretty sure if the mask is not your primary protection, you can use anything that is porous to air as a facemask even a tissue paper.  Just be sure to secure tightly so you don't touch your face while in use.  And then follow proper procedure for sanitizing your hands before taking off and disposal. Keep turning those knobs buddy /salute We can only test: people who have been overseas in the last 14 days and have cough or fever; healthcare workers with fever; severe bilateral pneumonia. We are massively under testing. Neither of the two positive cases in my city met testing criteria and both have no idea where they got it. This comment simply doesn’t apply to the situation we’re heading into The stock market is tanking anyways.  It knows whats up.  The US incompetent lack of testing means tracing is a completely useless strategy to mitigate now.  We must assume everyone has it and the sombering study from the UK says that even with maximum measures, the need for ICU's will far exceed our surge capacity by several factors.Here's hoping that chloroquine or one of the other promising drugs is available en mass to mitigate the effects especially the lung fibrosis that's requiring so many infected to be hospitalized. gf-gsw Something you can write on, thought to have originated from Egyptian papyrus I think there are many reagent manufacturers over Europe. I don't know what I would do but by clearing of based on symptoms/clinical examination one does create spreaders sooner or later. Priority 4, give them morph,  get them into the shade and have their mate hold their hand and talk with them. Once you stabilise Pri 3's, go back and check your 4 to try to evac them. The mind is often our worst enemy. This is simplified as best I could. If you’re immunocompromised, your immune system has been suppressed or weakened whether through other preexisting conditions or through drugs like chemotherapy meds. Your body’s white blood cell count ends up lower than normal and you end up being vulnerable to more things whereas a healthy immune system could fight off the majority of things and limit the impact on your body. When you get sick, your body would send WBCs to fight the virus but with a low WBC count and weak immune system, your body cannot effectively fight off the virus, leading to a “worse course” as it infects more cells. It just means they’re at risk for worse outcomes with more moderate/severe symptoms compared to someone who has a healthy immune system. I hope this answers your question! Chicago according to their comment history. LEEEROYYYYYY    JENKINNNNNNNS To everyone working in a medical laboratory: is your lab or country having problems with obtaining reagents for DNA extraction? We (South Korea) recently had to beg Roche to please send more reagents because the PCR testing volume went through the ceiling. I understand this 100% but this is a nationwide problem and completely out of my hands. We are an island. Apparently the test reagent is made in Italy? They’re keeping it for themselves so we’ve been told. Could mushrooms contain the cure to this virus?\"Antiviral compounds isolated from the mushrooms have shown potential activity against prominent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, etc.\" ? C [removed] Agreed. I had ERT (emergency response team) training before, and we learned triage for mass casualty situations. It was a tough lesson, but our goal is to maximize how many people come out of it alive. If someone is near death, you actually declare that person deceased. You do not spend time trying to save that person until after the triage is done. Normally, for non-disaster situations, the goal is to save that one person, buying time for the paramedics to arrive [this video](https://www.cottagehealth.org/covid-19-video/)  has some good info. I believe later on in this presentation it shows the accuracy.  Having a broch is the most accurate followed by sputum..... My city is likely about to get hit hard. I'm a little scared, but I'm ready as I'll ever be.If I die I'm going to haunt all of the CMOs. Engineers and fire signs (Sagittarians, Leos, Aries). I know this comes not really helpful from an academic tertiary center, but fight for tests at every cost. Clincal presentation and symptoms are neither specific nor sensitive. We've seen positives in asymptomatic contact persons or just a mere sore throat. Majority of inital presentations afebrile. Data is powered by PowerBI, here a link: http://aka.ms/covidreportI don't have ICU numbers for US, [here](https://i.imgur.com/KVoY56R.png) is what I have You're not wrong, and I guess I should've stated that the patient in my example was just contact precaution, not droplet, airborne, or contact + droplet. If they had coronavirus it would be very different. It's a matter of understanding how the disease that requires them to be isolated is transmitted when making these decisions. The point is that even that event was an emergency if there wasn’t a risk of infection and you weren’t being hit with a pandemic.   In the middle of everything, that is kind of a selfish thing to do...sure you get to feel like you saved that patient (because you obviously did) but at the expense of many others and the safety of yourself and coworkers. RN here. Don’t go back early. Rest. Heal. And love on your new baby. My daughter is 7 months old. I am not doing anything to risk her health. I am not doing anything to risk my health and leave her without a mom. If you get sick you think the hospital will care about you? You think they’ll remember you in a few months? Screw all that. I’ll do my job. If the hospital does not have enough PPE I’m not going in the patients room. I am not risking my life for anyones except my child’s. Is it after they seem to fully revover in some cases? Hit it with a UV sterilizer or ozone machine. &gt; Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China. And so onRemoved under rule 2/3 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. As a universal healer in any game I play, I want to just say its people like you who give me that glimmer of decency and help me continue to play. Thank you friend. Am I dumb or why do people keep saying immunosuppression is a risk for worse course? Does tylenol not have same upregulation of receptor? [removed] As a paramedic, thank you. This is what first contact emergency health workers need to learn to do. Slow down, don, proper PPE prior today Pt contact. Also Doff PPE correctly as well. This post might literally be a lifesaver. Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene  than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China.Due to the shortage of masks for which should be better used for doctors ?Or because the masks helps little to prevent for the virus yet hands hygiene helps a lot? This question confuses me a lot as I saw few people wearing masks in videos or pictures.I would appreciate so much if anyone could tell me where I can find the answer. Really? I thought they lowered the standards because of low supply when in fact N95 is preferred/recommended. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-15/amid-protective-gear-shortages-healthcare-workers-risk-becoming-part-of-the-problem Maybe reach out to the Department of Health (state or federal) and see if they have needs. Go ahead and collect the recovered case counts from the various public health websites yourself and show me that it’s 7,000. Until then, I’ll go with the agglomeration websites, which by and large have been remarkably consistent. Yeah but they mostly say severe ones like cancer/transplants/heart disease/diabetes etc. I couldn’t see any specifics for autoimmune conditions. It's obscene that people are being expected to deduct isolation time from paid time off. Especially medical professionals. Incredibly disgusting.Not that it's a new problem or anything. But you'd think that now of all times... So, an agglomeration site, not a public health organisation of any sort. Yeah, no. Don’t most news sources say that older folks and people with health complications/are immunocompromised are at higher risk? Not only that, but he didn't know that it had happened and immediately asked a random staff member of he did it. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#recovered [deleted] This.

May your family get through this quickly and with good health.  Good luck. Taiwan is right next to China and got 20 currently sick and 47 that got better. Both of your countries did not fire top pandemic staff because they gave mpre than average pushpack from cutting budgets to build a monumentally stupid wall. Donald Trump and his followers needs to own every single, avoidable  bad case of this disease I don't disagree but looking through their history this sub isn't one they typically post in and the comment didn't include anything new so I thought it would be useful to recommend searching the sub before posting as they clearly hadn't seen it discussed here despite it coming up quite often over the past few weeks. I just feel like it’s not taken seriously as if I had a serious illness etc. I’m trying to find anything that states autoimmune conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis) actually put me in a higher risk :( Listen to me. If you are autoimmune and you can self isolate - Do it. Regardless of your profession, you cannot help anyone - in any capacity - if you are infected, on a vent, or dead. You are in the category that is at a statistically higher chance of complications + death. Just my .02 cents thinking too many negative thoughts. alone, imagining healthcare bankruptcy it’ll happen Yea I feel you.  Have my baby sleeping on me now  and I’m  kinda freaked out about what the next several months will be like. It’s a little Is this your first?  I’m glad this is #2 for us because with the first one I had no clue what I was doing (sometimes still feel that way).Good luck to you both. Seems like the use of N95s is overzealous in both examples.

A formidable source of contagion\"](https://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina-e-ricerca/2020/03/16/news/coronavirus_studio_il_50-75_dei_casi_a_vo_sono_asintomatici_e_molto_contagiosi-251474302/?ref=RHPPTP-BH-I251454518-C12-P3-S2.4-T1)  &gt;  &gt;(Coronavirus: \"Il 50-75% dei casi a Vo' sono asintomatici. Una formidabile fonte di contagio\")  &gt;  &gt;*Letter from the immunologist Romagnani to the Tuscany Region based on a research carried out on the sick of the Venetian village.* *\"Now we must try to find these people, because nobody is afraid of them or isolates them\"*  &gt;  &gt;**ROME** \\- \"The vast majority of people infected with Covid-19, between 50 and 75%, are completely asymptomatic but represent a formidable source of contagion\". The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence **Sergio Romagnani** writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of [Vo 'Euganeo](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/24/news/coronavirus_vo_euganeo_no_allo_stop_c_e_da_lavorare_la_lite_nella_chat_del_paese-249409885/) where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.  &gt;  &gt;The immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo 'Euganeo highlight two very important information: \"the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease \".  &gt;  &gt;For Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is \"trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. \" And again: \"It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo 'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated \".  &gt;  &gt;In Vo '- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.I assume [la Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/) is a reliable news source? (I've heard it's as reputable as NYT/Wa Po/etc. Can anyone confirm?) My kids will be fine. I'm worried about young children particularly from low socioeconomic areas who don't have access to internet learning, may already be behind in reading or math, and don't have mothers posting their color-coded daily homeschooling schedules and monthly Lego activity calendars on Facebook. Vulnerable populations of children will fall further behind by missing the entire rest of the school year. What about the kids with special needs? The autistic kids who benefit from therapeutic school environments?

Is this the temporary firebreak type vaccine? Worrying about what to do about work, I have autoimmune issues and immune health conditions plus allergies and weak immune system on corticosteroids. I will receive full pay to self isolate but I just can’t fathom doing so or that my bosses will be at all happy about this.Just because they aren’t extremely serious health conditions I feel like I’m in a grey area. I can’t really find much info about autoimmune conditions and covid, can anyone point me to some info? It’s the third rule from House of God - in a cardiac code, the first procedure is to take your own pulse. That doesn't track with any reputable reports ice seen so far. Can you provide a source? According to today's WHO situation report, there's a total of 167511 total confirmed cases world wide. Your number would mean that half of all the people that have been confirmed infected have recovered, which simply isn't plausible given the recent hikes in numbers. In most places, tests are only being reported positive/added into the totals once confirmed. I.e. my institution had 2 confirmed inpatient, 8 at home, plus another 50 or so PUIs. State only reports a hundred total cases or so. But there are obviously way more than just my hospital in the state Who issued the restriction? If it came through the executive branch of government, then the police non emergency line. If it came from public health authorities, they should have a telephone number, and will probably take interest in physicians who are ignoring notices. A few months of missed school is mostly just fine. It could be a hassle for kids going into their last year of school and exams, but we can do things like delay exams. Even defer a school year entirely. These are social constructs not fixed in stone.Parent sanity is another thing entirely... but I guess I have to cope. No nation's economy will bounce back from a wave of mass deaths and panic either. Leaders cannot ignore this and hope it will go away. I wish they'd see that \"the economy\" exists as part of and for society, it is not an isolated virtual entity that can be considered in isolation from workers/consumers/producers/infrastructure/transport mechanisms as human beings. Better to have a longer period of measured disruption with lots of compensatory and supportive measures like government funded sick leave minimums, limited access small class childcare for critical workers, even temporarily introduce basic income. But no.Social and mental health impacts concern me too. I've been home with a 6yo and 3yo almost all the time since Friday. 6yo has a cough, probably nothing but better be cautious and protect others. Plus it's our small way to slow the spread and buy time. But OMG it's frustrating. We'll need to start getting out more once eldest is better, doing limited and cautious social contact a bit. Balance risk with sanity and kids mental health too. (layperson peeking out from lurking, hope it's ok deep in the child comments).CPAP was invented for hospital respiratory support before its later deployment in home sleep aponea treatment, right? My son was on CPAP+O2 for a couple of days after a difficult birth.I know CPAP is not a substitute for a proper ventilator. Even bilevel CPAP doesn't deliver negative pressure for forced exhalation, and it's an open system so there's all the risk of spraying potentially infectious droplets everywhere.But I'm curious about the extent to which consumer CPAP could be hacked to help, possibly in combination with mechanical exhalation support (bands, etc), outflow filtering, etc. Even basic devices have exhalation pressure relief now and bilevel is much more common.I found the recently posted article on the Las Vegas shootings fascinating (and very sad) too, especially using one ventilator for multiple patients by multiplying volume and using Y tubing. Crazy but awesome.I have two MD friends (both ex-ER, one ex-general-surgeon, both now GPs) who have been expressing frustration at the lack of visibility of any efforts being made to plan for these sorts of \"better than nothing\" emergency measures. They don't Reddit so I figured I would ask. I strongly advocate for all facial hair. Anyone who worked with that nurse needs to be quarantined.  Else congratulations on starting a new cluster. I think you're right.&amp;#x200B;However, politicians have friends with money in the markets. Their sentiment towards everyone else?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roNlgIY9QKw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roNlgIY9QKw) This is really wonderful, good 4 you. I’m just replying so I can copy paste and share this. I also work in healthcare. It’s important everyone stay safe. Our staff is invaluable. Saw a comment here from a PA about a nurse hoarding N95 to swab a patient. PA wanted an n95, nurse shrugged them off. PA got pissed, went to find charge nurse and nurse suddenly ''found'' the box in the drawer. I think the bigger issue there was the hoarding, but the provider wanted an n95 for swabbing.&amp;#x200B;Currently a new thread about patient treatment prior to result of swab. Nurse describes Droplet PPE (not including hair/eye pro)[https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjv7le/the\\_magic\\_swab\\_test/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjv7le/the_magic_swab_test/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I’m worried that it’s reducing effectiveness of social distancing. People see only 20 or so cases in our decently sized city and think nbd, but I can’t imagine we have fewer than hundreds to thousands of cases at this point. Is there any significant differences between N95 for HCW and N95 for other work? still always good to bring it up again as new information has been cropping up daily.that being said, it’s being used but still experimental and i am eager for more information as well. \"Hey everybody, I'm a Redditor who has no experience at all with medical care, but I think I know more than a professional so I will try and shit on them for karma.\"in before the edit:\"edit:   Guys, why the downvotes?  I'm just trying to save lives?\" My trust is telling us that even if correct PPE hasn’t been worn to not self-isolate unless we get symptoms. We’re currently looking after confirmed COVID-19 patient along with others. But it will upset stockholders! pictures of similar types of examples for those rusty on their oropharynx physical exam would be useful. With what do you decon yours, please? That's a legitimate fear, but more people are going to die if you do nothing. You can always ask the newspaper to remain anonymous. Please call and tell the newspaper what's happening. Lives are at stake. Sounds risky and should only be a last resort if PPE runs out. Not familiar with that product.  Are you saying it will filter a virus? &gt; Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now.There have been radiologists that work remotely and have hospitals outsource to them for years. Can anyone who’s been seeing cases of COVID-19 give a more detailed description of signs and symptoms?  Specifically I’m interested in the appearance of the oropharynx. Is it very erythematous? Papular erythema? Tonsillitis? Petechiae? I’m a GP working in Australia where we’re rapidly running out of test kits and we’re very restricted on who we can test. When there was an Ebola outbreak and the volunteer doctors sometimes got infected I thought, \"How does Ebola get through their hazmat suits?\"  Then I learned that the dangerous time was when doctors took that stuff off after a long shift - they've been working long hours in the African heat, they're thirsty, they need the toilet, their faces are dripping sweat and they can't wipe them... If the outside of the Hazmat suit wasn't properly disinfected with a spray, the doctor could easily come into contact with all the infectious fluids on the outside of the suit which had come from their patients (and as Ebola causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding, there could be a lot of these). Not making sure the outside of the suits was thoroughly disinfected was a matter of life and death for these doctors. I have profound admiration for all of the healthcare workers who volunteered their services to work in such unpleasant and distressing circumstances, to try to stop it spreading any further. Don't understand why people are saying a year+ disruption to life.China got their outbreak under control almost completely in a month and a half. They now have a manageable influx of cases that can likely be controlled with good surveillance and precaution among healthcare professionals. Life will largely be able to go back to normal in Wuhan soon.There's a false dichotomy here. People will not be able to go back to life where we weren't taking basic COVID precautions like staying home if you were sick, washing your hands, etc., until a vaccine is available, but social distancing CAN more or less end if we commit HARD, right now, before the spread is overwhelming. Dithering at this moment commits us to \"let's get it over with\" and hundreds of thousands - millions of dead. Yet our hospital just changed their quarantine policy to only quarantine if you are symptomatic and no longer quarantine for suspected exposure. What a bunch of clowns. This is my understanding.  What were the qualms expressed in the comments? I think virus negative on PCR I love you. Thank you for your sanity, patience, and effort. It’s very helpful. I’m an old retired person who used to have a medical license, but I am the resource person for maybe 100 real (not virtual) people. Would you post your link to animal rescue again? People can be asymptomatic and be shedding large amounts of the virus. All patients with suspected contact with the virus should be tested and self isolated as per the WHO since current screening is ineffective. However, with the testing issues in the US, this may not be feasible. Ugh. Rest in peace, doctor Xia. Probably change in case counts over a few days. When the increase in cases starts to go down, it's getting under control. Nurse here:What are the recommended precautions for these patients?I was under the impression it's droplet + eye/hair protection. Airborne precautions in case of aerosolizing procedures (intubation, bronchoscopy). It is also my understanding that after the procedure they are back to droplet.&amp;#x200B;Is this true?Ive seen two posts/comments with complaints about PPE even though the PPE listed seemed appropriate I’m still trying to figure out how the self quarantined person ended up with a gsw. Where are you? My hypothesis is keeping the economy from collapsing.&amp;#x200B;Any worse news and stocks will dive another 10+%. Emotional times in the market. There's about 80,000 recovered individuals right now. If you get sent to isolation today, who will pop that in tomorrow?That's the point. You being healthy and uninfected will contribute to saving many many more people than you saving 1 infected person today and then being stuck at home for weeks.It's not business as usual, it's a pandemic. You're going to lose people and it's going to fucking suck. But society can't afford to lose you and your expertise. Who do we report them to? I know for a fact that my hospital had more positive tests today than is being reported in the news for the state. I don't really know what the disconnect is. It is found in feces, respiratory secretions and blood per [this report](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-covid-19-may-spread-several-different-ways). &amp;#x200B;There's even evidence to suggest a fecal oral transmission. Icu Rn here. I feel absolute gross having to reuse my n95 Thanks This has been covered extensively for weeks, search the subreddit if you want more information.https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fbfj0r/covid19_prophylaxis_in_healthcare_workers/ Yeah, especially the Facebook post doesn't sound remotely close to what I'd consider mild. Milder than a bad case of the flu, maybe, but that's a maybe. I am debating going against the policy they set via email which is, essentially, “work unless you’re displaying symptoms.” I think any of us who came into contact with this nurse should self isolate but that would be a lot of people so I can see why they don’t want that. I agree. The clinic recently instituted a policy of essentially “work unless you have symptoms of COVID” which, given the literature, doesn’t sit right with me. Yeah, we have plenty of droplet precaution masks and gloves in clinic, but not enough N95s and to be used in highly suspicious cases of covid only. I've been told we have goggles, just don't know where. Definitely makes me nervous because we'll probably start having Healthcare workers get sick as we get more cases, and that will create a much more difficult situation. Same goes for us in funeral service. Oh my bad. Please report them if you can. Same thing happened to me. Had to fight tooth and nail with my family to get them to stay put. Was successful but saw a lot of friends who I had personally talked to going out to bars. Lost a lot of respect for some folks, don't know if I can ever look at them the same again. Rule 2 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. You’re the exact person this is meant for.....smh Good Evening,I had a thought after watching these two videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7F1cnWup9M&amp;t=2s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE4_LsftNKM&amp;t=4sIt seems like hydroxychloroquine is being used in China, South Korea and now Australia (where they are calling it a cure) to treat COVID-19. As a pretty common drug its widely available, and it seems that it would be good to take as a preventive treatment for COVID-19 for first responders and healthcare workers who might be exposed to a high viral load by the nature of their job, and, if the reports out of China, South Korea and Australia are right, it might mean a much more mild course of illness for first responders and healthcare workers who contract the illness. Its wide availability and low side effects in most people seem like its worth the risk, if it does work as suggested.What do you all think? I'm in a similar position as an RN with a 5 week old (that was 5 weeks premature and spent 3 weeks in the nicu). If they need me back early I'm going to go back most likely. My husband is not happy but we need my income and it's just part of the job. It's not an easy decision with a newborn. If I'm dead but I'm #1 in dps that's a win in my book. Thread I had with an Infectious Disease doctor on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ffulwq/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_9th_2020/fk12m2l/?context=10000 &gt; Slow is smooth and smooth is ~~quick~~ fast.But yes, absolutely. One of my favorites. What is PAPR (insert PnR meme)? China put a draconian but highly effective quarantine into place. South Korea managed to surge test people, and quarantine any positives efficiently. Without similar measures, it just won't happen. It's very real. Even 100m sprinters are taught to take their time. Don't rush it. My postop lung transplx patient coughed her T-piece off and desatted to 80% in a few seconds. I ran in and popped it on and it was a full minute before her o2 sats stabilized. You're totally right, we should be careful what determines an emergency, but in the ICU it is very situational. These patients are on and off all kinds of support, and they lack any reservoir. A single bad event can be critical to their stability in some of these sickest of pts. Generally speaking, you're right. Most events dont require true urgency. But there are places and times where we need to move. That's what happens when your healthcare system gets overrun. Patients that might make it with intensive care die, because you don't have the intensive care capacity for the number of cases. [removed] Exactly.  The way your outbreak was discovered was mind blowing to me.  A researcher who went against the government to test for covid in her flu study discovers community spread...WTF.  Supposedly, we have such a critical shortage of masks and other protective equipment in CO that they’re going to shut down testing unless they figure out how to get more.  Geniuses. I’m not sure on if they can force her or not. It’s kind of a moot point with my wife. She isn’t going to say no if they ask her to come back early.  She  is close with everyone there and her being gone means everyone else has to work even harder. We are lucky because we will be able to get help from family and I have a very flexible job. Layperson here.  I have zero connection to healthcare, aside from being a patient more often than I'd like.  I've been reading these threads on r/medicine for the last 3-4 weeks; it's my primary source of information, and I feel like it's helped me stay ahead of this thing and take proper actions for myself.  I try to pass pieces of it along to those I care about. I have a 65y/o mother with diabetes, hypertension, and on long-term immunotherapy for CLL who refuses to stay home.  Given the PPE shortages and inexcusable failures of our government at all levels to establish ANY kind of plan to mitigate disaster, I also come here for sobering reminders in cold clinical language that affirm my outwardly healthy, vibrant, awesome mom is likely going to die a totally preventable death that I could see from a mile away and was entirely powerless to stop. I love you, medical professionals.  I hate you, healthcare system.  I respect you, science. Business people should also then understand that forcing staff to work without PPE exposes them to being sued for negligence and workers compensation claims.  Not to mention whistle blowers going to the media, in the current climate how do you think a hospital forcing people to work without PPE is going to go with the public? I find this so confusing because the virus seems to have tapered off somewhat quickly in China and South Korea. Should I shave my beard? [deleted] The situation in Italy is bad. &amp;#x200B;Check out the video. Patients unmonitored. Some gorked needing tubed. Mortality not surprising. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=1&amp;v=U6yeSQr1VGk&amp;feature=emb\\_title&amp;fbclid=IwAR2\\_RW4RD8IYdwvP31hnOjmUCXbtG5e0ux66taAlHOT41SOjgYeVm\\_MKfGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=U6yeSQr1VGk&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;fbclid=IwAR2_RW4RD8IYdwvP31hnOjmUCXbtG5e0ux66taAlHOT41SOjgYeVm_MKfGk) If you have confirmed direct contact with a COVID positive patient, you should not see patients.  You are contagious prior to symptom onset. Avg symptom onset is 5-7 days from exposure but can be up to 14 days. Not having symptoms is not reliable indicator. Non-urban, Wisconsin (so some people are probably wayyyyy out of the loop here). Treat non-covid pt's on the boat.  Leave hospitals for the infected. I was so heartened by this effort before I read the page and realized they don’t know what a ventilator is. 14 day self quarantine until enough tests become available. Inability to test is absolutely handcuffing care. That is so tough. I couldn’t imagine having to go back to work so soon after having a baby. Especially to a to that kind of work during this time. Assuming she used FMLA, can they force her to go back before 12 weeks? I love these. I feel like I'm a time traveler from the future who has discovered your diary. Please keep going! Can someone comment on how accurate our PCRs are? Should I trust a negative? or is each lab a little different? It doesn't matter. The US apparently only had 1% of the N95 masks on-hand required for an event like this. The hoarders are annoying, but they aren't the problem. Poor planning is. No the phrase is in english, not korean, so dedpite bad grammar i kept it I would talk to your supervisor and explain that you have what you think is close exposure and ask what to do. They might want you to get tested? But that would mean you would have to have access to tests and be out until the results come back. Clearly they have WAY more infections that they don't know about.But the number of deaths and ICU cases for a country that size is terrifying. I would be wearing a properly fitting N95 respirator and gloves at a minimum. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching anything like your phone, keys and wallet. Be very aware of what you touch with your hands and use alcohol wipes on your personal items. Stay safe. Right. Translated instead of interpreted to make it sound mystical. And what about steroid allergy nose sprays like fluticasone? I didnt cuz its not a proverb. Its the catch phrase of koreans jr drs association. They found no virus in blood, urine, or feces (other than viral rna).  I’d love to know if it’s in breast milk. [deleted] In the POTUS &amp; Co address today, they mentioned they're working in the upcoming bill to allow N95 masks/cartridges to be supplied by companies who supplied N95 masks to industry (I'm assuming this is mostly opening up product lines). Their claim is this would open up a significant amount of domestic production capacity for hospital use. I took this being there is a lot of production capacity for OSHA approved N95 masks which aren't certified for health care use. Check this team out! They're looking at 3D printing ventilators. [Project Open Air](https://www.projectopenair.org/) Thank you. I love the way the data is displayed-is there a link to access these graphs daily?Also, is there a way to view ICU bed usage within the US? That would tell us how close we are to crashing into the iceberg in the States.. Think about the logistics - you'd have to cram a bunch of possibly contagious people on a boat to get them to the ship in the first place, then you'd be shipping them to a box crammed with people. I've never served on one, but those boats are probably better suited for disaster relief than contagion. Fair enough, thanks! That's basically where I'm at as well. absolutely I haven’t looked at the primary data and honestly have no business commenting. Thanks for thinking of us. We have, at least, convinced leadership to cancel all live shows and most food service at the casino. Sanitation has been doubled. I just know it won't be enough. I also know where we will all be without casino profits. It's a tough spot to be in. Your prayers have been answered, kind stranger.  We NIPPV'd the (figurative) shit out of the toilet.  The ghost of my face has been banished. For now. It’s the nurse who sits next to me who was coughing last week who tested positive. I last saw her on Wednesday and I haven’t taken a test and dont have symptoms. I actually just spent an entire hour talking to my doc about this situation and he's frustrated because the people in power aren't making smart choices. And again, we're in Seattle, and his network's team isn't making smart choices. No, that patient was from the SCJ cult while the salt spraying church is nominally mainstream. Well mainstream by Korean standards given that they performed faith healing and were doing so on the day of the salt spraying. Nearly 8% mortality? Jesus. &gt; they’re run by businessmen.Go cough on them. BSI, scene safety Someone edit the Supplies! gif so they're all wearing masks. A favorite movie of mine too. Hence the username. Seems a little overly antagonistic now given that my main use of reddit is moderating but, well... sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes he eats you.I would jump at temporary housing. I am slightly worried for my own health but would be devastated if I brought something dangerous home to my family. Was it you or the other nurse who tested positive. Hipster vegans Thanks for the update, I’ve been wondering how different Tribes have been preparing for this. I really hope that you’re able to convince tribal leadership, it sounds like everyone is in a really difficult spot. I haven't been on social in several days because I've spent every waking hour trying to convince my tribal leadership to take this seriously. No one outside of health care is listening to me because they don't want to close the casino. THIS IS NOT GREED- our tribe is not part of IHS and gaming funds our health care (and everything else). The bill before congress only expands Medicaid and IHS funding. We are on our own. I am exhausted and we haven't even been hit yet.  Though, if we were testing I know of several cases that would likely be positive. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. Plungers are like BIPAP. The key is getting a good seal. Oh good, we're running out of surgical masks (and we have 0 confirmed cases, and are doing extraordinarily few tests) so we're expected to reuse those/put them in a bag. I raised the same point as above - any particles on the outside will get on the inside - and was then told it only applies to the nurses (I'm a resident). I was like...that's not any better, the same is still true for them, but haven't gotten a response yet. Unfortunately, that's a totally different skill and equipment set than what we're set up for (capital equipment like ventilators, etc) :( Not just economic. Think about all of the children who aren't in school learning. Also the emotional/psychological toll of extreme social distancing. Ours are being canceled starting tomorrow. True, someone recently characterized a mild COVID19 case as \"the worst cold you will ever have in your life and live through it.\"Having had bacterial pneumonia before and currently working with COVID19 patients, I hope I will be one of those asymptomatic cases, since the bacterial pneumonia experience was already bad enough. Right, that's what I'm saying it's not 'mild symptoms' that's pretty severe. It's super shitty. At the end of the day, protect your family. Get your wife to ensure that her employer has facilities for them to wash coming to &amp; from work. Your wife should ALWAYS ensure that she wears her PPE. Also when leaving for the day she should change her clothes and wash thoroughly. Put the clothes into a plastic bag and either leave them sealed outside or wash them immediately upon returning home. Do what you can to protect yourself. And even more importantly, do everyhting in your power to protect the residents of her home. You guys need to practice social isolation more than anyone. If there's a single case in that LTC facility, there's a high likelihood of multiple fatalities. It's an hypothesis at this point AFAICT:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext So no ketorolac either in your opinion? The direct care nurse gave me shift report too. She wasn't wearing PPE for duration of care because she had no reason to. Management should have sent her home immediately but we are short staffed already. People arent taking it seriously enough.... Does anyone have any knowledge about ACE2 upregulation with any NSAID's besides ibuprofen? I'm specifically looking at ketorolac. It would be nice to have a non-opioid for muscle/joint pain that isn't going to increase susceptibility to infection by COVID (if that in fact happens with ibuprofen at all, which is just a hypothesis for now). I don't have much time to do a deep dive at the moment, so anything would help.This is referring to the Lancet article linked below:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext I’ve been posting all over worried about my fathers PPE but now a nurse that I sit next to had a bad cough last week. She tested positive for the virus over the weekend. They want me to come in anyway since no symptoms but I feel very concerned after seeing reports of transmission pre-symptoms. I do not want to transfer this to my patients who are primarily acute and elderly. Should I stay home? I am thinking primarily of this article that was shared here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1Does the evidence seem compelling enough to people that I should self isolate or would PPE be enough to abate most concerns of accidentally infecting those I come into contact with?FWIW I’m at an outpatient clinic this week. They showed a study on that at last week's grand rounds.  From SARs-1, but surgical masks were non inferior.  Still, for aerosol inducing procedures (bronch, intubation), I'd definitely want an N95 Unfortunately we’re one of the bigger pediatric hospitals in the US. I’m too afraid to lose my job otherwise I would. to be fair, pneumonia does that to you. Even if you dont have ARDS, the weakness will be with you for some time. Slow is smooth and smooth is quick. I figured it would be old news, I just had to check. Are you in a major city? Have you thought about going to local news, as well? If the news reports that local hospitals are not equipped, I (hope) more people will take their quarantines seriously and it might lessen the load 10-12 days from now. Q: How can you tell if there's a jet pilot at a party?A: Don't worry, we'll tell you. Can I rephrase then?Are we close to having an antibody test? Because I’m wondering if, given the very low reinfection rates, once healthcare workers (such as myself) get COVID-19 can we test for/establish immunity? Maybe rent a furnished studio for her? Will be cheaper than a hotel at least What’s the best case scenario? You feel better for a few hours but follow the same general disease trajectory.What’s the worst case? You increase viral uptake and have a more severe disease course.I’ll stick with Tylenol, thanks. Plus..... you guys need tanks at the ready... You know just in case. Our hospital systems’ leadership cancelled elective surgeries today (our state coronavirus rate was at 26 at the time of the announcement), which surprised and impressed me. Also. Plowing money into buying ventilators and equipment is not going to magically train the army of specialists required to use them. Hell even the cleaning staff are specially trained in our intensive care ward. We've been told we may have to improvise masks out of vaccine bags. This situation really has shown up massive shortcomings in both funding and the planning. There's for sure a lot of variables here that are very hard to predict. I hope your government would step in with some kind of social safety net in that case, I doubt that scenario would happen here in Sweden. thats insane man :( Are they considering that if we keep everything shut down like this for more than a month or so, a bunch of lower income service workers are going to be out on the streets, since they won't be able to make rent? Social distancing isn't going to happen in the homeless camps and breadlines that spring up. I do worry that if we do too much social distancing, it's going to bite us in the ass. Hospitals are already reusing disposable N95's...so...reusable is actually a plus here. Just showed up to work today. An elective surgical patient with bilat pnuemonia exposed ~25 healthcare workers and is being tested for it now.  Essentially an entire floor of staff along with Anesthesia and RT. I don't understand why elective surgeries aren't being canceled. Ours is having us wear a surgical mask over the N95 to keep droplets from contaminating the front of the mask, so it can be more safely reused. Luckily we aren't running out of surgical masks yet. I saw posts on one of these mega threads about HCW avoiding exposing their family. The general consensus was HCW should wear scrubs that the hospital launders, or have a designated \"dirty\" room at home. When you get home, you strip in the \"dirty\" room, wash your clothes and take a shower before coming into contact with the rest of the family.It's not...great. But it's better than nothing? You can also tip it to propublica: https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/we-want-to-talk-to-people-working-or-living-on-the-front-lines-of-coronavirus-help-us-report We were told not to come in. If we were sick enough to wear a mask at work we'd be sent home. Occurrences for call outs and needing to burn through your pto (fuck you if you're low on that for any reason) to take this time off still apply. Maybe they are symptoms of zinc supplementation catching on? Today situation in Italy[link Italy 3/16](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vhulmcbii5rnao/Microsoft%20Power%20BI.pdf?dl=0) Yellow - ICURed - DeathsOrange - RecoveredPlease spread the message to stay at home; it is for our safety. Do it before it becomes bad as it is here in Italy right now PGY2 Neurosurgery Resident I second mask and other standard PPE. Our hospital is low on N95's and has no Papr hoods, for those who need them. If you can't get the raw materials needed for those, even simple stuff like surgical masks, gowns, and gloves are in limited supplies. I know it's not necessarily the most exciting engineering challenge, but it's really what's needed. PPE, vents need people to operate them This is what truly sucks for our situation. We have one bathroom and no garage, wife is an NP caring for an entire LTC home of 100+ patients. I can't think of any way to maintain good protection for me and the kids in this situation. We've been talking about putting her up in a hotel but how the hell can we afford that for months? Your fist job is to fly that damn plane, your second job is to navigate it around safely (cause you can't navigate anywhere if you're a ground dart), your third job is to communicate. No one cares if you managed to follow proper protocols with ATC if your plane dug a hole. Did you see this hackathon for creating an open-source ventilator? Some interesting comments at the bottom too [https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/](https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/) I believe so. I cannot find the article but they believe most providers who get sick do so by infecting themselves accidentally while donning/doffing PPE Wow, what state are you in? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5.pdf Totally agree.  At the very least, temporary housing for exposed staff should be made available so that healthcare workers have the option to isolate themselves if they feel it necessary.  Maybe the stockpiles don’t exist. That could be.  Then maybe we need to consider dedicating facilities to Covid 19 patients.  Rapid 4 hour testing prior to admission would make this possible in large urban communities.There are so many ways this terrible situation could be addressed without throwing millions of healthcare workers into a gunfight to do battle with butter knives. They are aware. Revenue seems to be more important at this point. It’s sad. &gt;With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.For what's it's worth, I've seen some evidence that surgical masks are just about as effective as N95 masks for protection. N95 masks have been recommended because they're known to filter particles as small as SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and preliminary reports of of China indicated that the virus *might* be able to aerosolize and be inhaled without filtration. However, since then, true widespread airborne transmission hasn't really been confirmed, and the consensus now seems to be that it mostly or only travels through respiratory droplets. *Surgical masks protect against droplets just as well as N95s*. It may be more reasonable to use home health services for other non-COVID cases as the respiratory compensation requiring intubation seems to be rather rapid. I agree that it needs to happen now - and that is why I explained how it will happen and when it will happen. The hospitals with higher levels of emergency preparedness are really shining right now and I feel horrible for everyone else. You shouldn't be in this position. Someone shared this with me here yesterday, [head of dept of anesthesia and ICU in a research hospital in Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKS1pahoPRU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=412) talking about his experience right now. They cancelled elective surgeries and had to increase capacity significantly to handle the surge. It sounds like they were extremely well-equipped to handle the situation, and it still continues to be difficult for them every day. Consider sharing it with your superiors or coworkers. I assume Italy's recommendations should not be taken lightly. He is such a fucking bastard. Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. it's respiratory.  PPE more important.  Should wash hands too [BBC also just reported that Alibaba co-founder is shipping supplies to us.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51904379) Unfortunately, much of this is not being reported in local news, maybe to limit panic? ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ It would lose  (⌐■_■) the element of supplies Maybe masks and other PPE? “No you’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”“All right then.”Favorite movie of all time. I empathize with your situation.  We’re sleeping in separate beds also.  At the very least, if hospitals are not providing proper PPE they should make temporary housing available for staff do they can reduce the chance of transmitting to their community.  This is what happened in China, correct?At a certain point, it does become a question of ethics, and I can see where you are coming from. At the same time, critical care RNs exposed to infectious patients for hours on end without proper PPE strikes me as dumb, counterproductive, and ethically wrong.   I’m the asshole in this ethical situation, and I know the subtext is that people don’t get care.  And yet if we look at italy, that’s the exact situation their healthcare providers are in.  So I don’t know what the answer is, except the situation is incredibly disturbing and I think we need to vocalize it so that the public is aware of what is happening. I totally agree that PPE should be made available to staff. Staff should be protected as well as be able to reduce spread between patients. It seems fucking obvious to me that cost should not be a factor, and if stockpiles exist, they should be distributed as required. My understanding is that, in many cases, there actually aren't stockpiles, and that ordering through the usual pathways is not helpful. What we shouldn't do is just abandon people in their hour of greatest need and close hospitals. Safest bet, if you have a mild to moderate case just take paracetamol(acetaminofen) to control your temperature. Beardless, Day 8  My other beared compatriot has also shaved now, but he went with a mustache. My jealous is palpable.  CostCo is out of toilet paper and baby wipes. I really just wanted carrots, so I'm good.  The promised plunger has arrived. Battle to commence. This is good stuff. Probably unrelated but reminds me of my work as airline pilot: We never rush, take our time. If not available, we make time. ESPECIALLY when shit hits the fan. My local hardware store still has a few half face respirators and filter kits available - P100. They are much more expensive ($40 for the respirator plus $20 per filter kit), but  being overlooked.Obviously, actually being able to use in the work place is a different story.---EDIT: I should clarify, this late Saturday night. Madness may have hit in the last day and changed this. As of late Saturday, masks where nearly wiped out but still a few respirators available. I've had a respirator for a while and wear it when I apply stains/finishes to woodwork. Most people don't seem to have an interest in $60+ of safety. Studies like this should help determine the length of time of isolation. Get a Google voice number [removed] Anyone know why the WHO's sitreps have now shown 2 consecutive days since a confirmed case in the US when that obviously isn't the case? Have we stopped reporting to the WHO or is this just oversight? NSAIDs: yay or nay? Lessons from China about proper PPE from Xihong Lin, a professor at the Harvard Department of Biostatistics (see slides 55-56).  The protocol in China is a protective suit, medical goggles, cap, face shield, mask, and gloves when seeing suspected COVID cases.  Using this level of protection, none of the 42,000 external doctors and nurses sent to Wuhan was infected, though some of the internal doctors were, before adequate PPE was used.https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tGJF9tdv4osPhY1-fswLcSlWZJ9zx45/edit I remember reading about mRNA vaccines a few years ago in an immunology text book, it was a relatively recent book, but they made it sound like these were a long way away.  I guess this is as good an opportunity as any to give it a try as we are in dire need of a vaccine and not having to wait for incubation would be huge.  Don't believe there are any other mRNA vaccines on the market. I'm not sure where you are but it hasn't hit us hard here in Canada yet. My girlfriend is also an ICU nurse. In the cardiovascular ICU which means that their unit is already setup with vent's and all the required equipment, one of the only ones in our city. They're not rushing everyone to renew their fit-tests and pretty much spending every shift doing more and more training. It's super stressful for us as she's 1 week into return to work after 12-months away with our baby. We've also had to setup pretty much a decontamination zone in the garage. She will change out of scrubs when leaving the hospital and will go into the garage and straight to the downstairs shower to scrub down. We'll be scrubbing that bathroom and the garage down on a daily basis. Thank you! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32077115?tool=bestpractice.comThat's about it plus a few experts who had access to inside data. [deleted] Dunno.Found this if interestedhttps://sci-hub.tw/https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243 Our hospital wants us to store our N95 masks in a bag with our name on it and reuse for multiple cycles. Seems counterproductive. If the mask is actually catching particles, aren't we just going to cross contaminate ourselves by putting on and off multiple times? Someone gold this Australia here, ran out of masks, using Bunnings p2 mask as first line specialist. The world has gone crazy. Odd mechanism. Are there any other vaccines that work through host translation of mRNA? We have an algorithm but it’s... not perfect. Because a huge chunk of what we spend on \"Healthcare\" isn't spent on healthcare. It's spent on administration, like our corrupt insurance \"industry\", hospital billing, chargebacks, medical loans (how insane is that??) etc. any evidence to debunk or verify claim?Whats the official verdict.

(I had two 24h shifts last week and after that I need sleep or I am a danger to my patients) Basically they don’t stockpile enough of this stuff for something like this. They typically order it when they need it and it shows up. Now everyone everywhere needs the same stuff at the same time - globally. Patients will need largely the same interventions provided by a small group of specialized healthcare providers. So we have a supply/demand issue there too. Similarly our hospitals are tailored to meet the demand they normally experience, but add corona virus on top of what has already been a bad flu season and you have a lot of sick people coming through the door.This is why it is important to flatten the curve. We can’t stop the virus but we can slow down the growth rate so that our healthcare system doesn’t get overwhelmed as badly. The good news is that the people who are in our healthcare system - every tech, nurse, pa, and doctor I know are intelligent, hardworking, and brave people. They are working hard to get prepared and they will do their best to help us all through this. Fuck. No way governments will go with that timeline (18 months in paper). They will pick an acceptable mortality over the economic hit that would cause. person\\* not just american First rule of Heavy Weapons Guy: protect the medic. If we rush in and the medic dies we all die and mission fails. I have a sandvich named \"Medic Chow\". It's not for me. It's for the guy saving my ass. Because regulations go against capitalism!  Stop forcing us to prepare for shit! The whole situation has exposed how stupid a lot of people are. It has made me a lot more cold and hardened unfortunately. Supermarkets empty. People hoarding. No regard for each other. There’s a lot to like in that article. Thank you. Kaiser Permanente Washington Vaccine trial: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04283461?term=mrna-1273&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 Yesterday I had to order an emerg CT on a SDH which my attending needed to decide on whether to operate as an emergency at night or the next day. It took 6h to get it because they have to clean out the CTs after every suspected covid. And my attending made me call and ask to please hurry with it two times (I apologized obv). And this is only the start, one CT is already designated only covids. We have no face shields, N-95, or PAPR on the unit we designated our COVID unit. They are only with the house supervisor at all times. I can only hope it changes but I don’t know it it will. Our pharmacist is vital to the RRT/code team. I just grabbed the code box of meds and told mine to stay out because of lack of equipment. It’s hard to shout in N-95 and through doors to get their expertise Medical device engineer, here. Say I have a US-based factory and team of engineers available. Is there anything we could be doing to help? We're tossing around ideas like \"Design and build crude emergency ventilators\", but it seems like anything we could do would take too long (even ignoring the regulatory considerations).Are there any needs for equipment that aren't being met? hi, do you have any source on that? (my gf has asthma and I keep trying to find any data on it) Yes, I’m not sure what the timeline on getting the end products...and in the meantime we’re just flying blind in the healthcare system. Whether it’s 16 days or 6 weeks, we’re talking about exponential growth of an infectious disease and we’re in an even worse position than China and Italy because we’re not the only healthcare system in crisis.  I know people don’t want to hear this and that’s why it’s not being reported as it should be.  It scares me just thinking about it. All sketchy data, but it seems to come on late, even after respiratory recovery. Also sketchy reports but in Italy they have supposedly been using echo to decide who to give vents to (avoiding those with newly diminished EF). People are talking about getting back to normal in a few weeks right now on the radio (NPR).I don't know, at some point we are going to have to decide what social distancing to maintain long term and what not to. I don't think we can keep schools closed for 18 months. You are so correct and honestly I’m a dumb ass when it comes to doing anything to help. I blame comics. It was a place I never thought I’d be and feel rattled by it. I absolutely did not risk myself without proper PPE and kicked out those who didn’t. We didn’t even have it on the unit or near this unstable individual. It was also a poor execution of transport. Our policy is to place a blanket of intubated patients and close doors. Our COVID unit is 2 elevators and 3 hallways away from ICU   and probably 1/4 mile total. We are out of PPE in a major midwest urban US hospital. Even surgical masks are under lock and key and are not being distributed outside ER/MICU. Patients still need to be seen in my clinic. We have canceled every appointment we can, and are able to re-route symptomatic patients to a dedicated COVID testing suite so we are lucky in that sense, but I still feel my odds of exposure are 100%. We know the infectious risk peaks right before/at the initiation of symptoms. I don't think I can (or will) ethically refuse to see patients who are very ill and on active treatment. I am thinking of at least starting to sleep on the couch to try to isolate myself from my family. This whole comment chain is a much needed window of fun in a pretty grim time. Thank you. Ive been asked this multiple and gave this exact response, but i started doubting myself after my shift. Dps saying thanks for the heals. Also, human saying thank you for being a real life healer. It requires a cell number confirmation too Imperial College has released their modeling of different mitigation/suppression strategies for this epidemic. Looks like we are in for a very long haul (until we get a working vaccine) unless we accept a high amount of mortality.https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf Yeah, it's giving me some trouble, it should be up and running soon. Feel free to try and use it but don't necessarily expect a swift answer. make a throwaway email and twitter handle whilst using a VPN. No one will know who you are. &gt; I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required.&gt; healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should.With as much as we spend on healthcare in the US, how the hell is it this bad?! One million US deaths in the best case scenario which seems to include 18 months of social distancing? Can you imagine what the world would be like a year from now? I can’t comprehend it. Apparently China forced manufacturers of other goods to start manufacturing PPE and hand sanitizer. A friend mind is from China and her extended family offered to send her a bunch of masks and hand sanitizer. We're in Seattle, so she was like, \"Hmmmm...\" She's MS though so she can work from home, so they're all pretty safe and security. You absolutely have to post before/after pics! We need something lighthearted. I don't see this the same as taking 30 seconds to throw on PPE.        Using \"due care\" as reasoning to be this reserved does not justify driving in a manner such as this all the time. There needs to be a balance and driving to emergencies is completely fluid based on severity of offense, other motorists, road conditions, etc.       Experience is the better teacher and if an experienced cop were to always be this reserved, they should additionally be prepared to have their actions highly scrutinized by the public and civilly litigated when it results it people dying.         I get where you're coming from but when there is an in-progress violent offense, or mass casualty event taking place, some of these recommendations for driving go straight out the window. Except PPE... where that crap. Damn, my asthma means every cold kicks my ass for 9 days. I just read this from NPR about how N95s are difficult to make, the manufacturers are running above 110% capacity and they are repurposing other factories to produce them ...https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-mak Eh I have asthma and that's pretty much what happens when I get a any old cold. And no paperwork. Nurses are pally tanks, have to tank and heal. surgeons are resto priests Meanwhile, I'm not even sure Trump is fluent in English... EUROPE - please, for the love of God, if you are a HCW of any sort and even though Europe is a hotspot for covid-19 and you still decide to go on trips to other countries especially and spend time with your friends, stay home for 14 days as the gov ordered few days ago. [this article ](https://www.cas.sk/clanok/958343/lekar-z-kramarov-ma-koronavirus-sokujuce-slova-kolegovej-manzelky-toto-vas-uplne-odrovna/) (article is in Slovak language) informs about a doctor from a major hospital in the capital city of Slovakia, who took a vacation in Austria, socialized with his friends, came back to Slovakia and did not stay home (mandatory 14 days or you get a fine) and went to work as usual, did surgeries, saw patients, worked in the ED and such and of course then he started coughing a lot and tested positive for covid-19. This resulted in quarantine for additional 27 HCW. So irresponsible. ### Removed under Rule 2:No personal health situations.

[removed] Seriously, they need to be taking this more seriously and start acting with a sense of urgency. What’s your institutions policy on staff working with URTI or LRTI symptoms? It seems to me that we can’t sustain having everyone off for mostly other viral cases, but that there is a fair bit of cases we will miss and allow to work if we aren’t somewhat strict in HCWs isolating when symptomatic. My wifes hospital is canceling all non emergency surgeries, pretty much just because the lack of PPE I would love to see them get interviewed and try to explain why they chose now of all times to take a completely impromptu road trip. I think in a few weeks Americans will have VERY strong negative feelings towards that kind of completely irresponsible behavior.I literally told my friend, who is objectively brilliant and very well-liked, you could literally be responsible for multiple deaths and never realize it. I have it in writing over text... But that just wasn't a persuasive argument somehow. This past week has honestly changed my opinion on human nature. Personal protective equipment, ie masks, gloves, etc The only issue for the re-usable respirators is that you have to disinfect everything except the filter parts of it before donning/doffing, otherwise you risk infection. They’re unavailable too It’s not about congress moving slow or the president promising to make them available. It hasn’t happened.  End of story.  They need to make it happen NOW otherwise we as healthcare workers are literally enabling the problem to get worse. Is there any _benefit_ to Paracetamol or NSAIDS in COVID.? I have seen several reports of NSAIDs being harmful, and some for paracetamol worsening outcomes in viral infections. Given this, I’m tempted to say just don’t give any paracetamol or NSAIDS unless temperature rises drastically to harmful levels. Would this lead to any harm? Personal Protective Equipment. Exactly.  I’ve seen reports in local news about staff reusing masks.  The FDA and CDC both support this practice in times of critical shortage.  It’s time we alert people that we’re in that period of crisis. Personal Protective Equipment, things like isolation gowns, gloves, &amp; masks. Personal protective equipment I'm trying to predict patient flow for my local area. Does anyone have any timeline-type references/resources that I can compare to my anecdotal impression of the emergency department? I've listened to many of the podcasts from Italian physicians and I feel like I should be anticipating a surge of pneumonias any minute. We started seeing quite a few r/o's about a week ago, and have steadily increased this volume so that about 30% of our census have been symptomatic rule outs as of this weekend. That being said, we have not had very many fulminant cases - maybe 5-10 that I am aware of in the last week or so (my last week's shifts have all been ED - surprise surprise).It doesn't help that our testing remains limited, and with a 3-5 day turnaround still common. My mom is also super religious, lives in south GA. Her church still hasn't canceled services...even though an entire family is in self quarantine due to their (adult) son who lives with them having all the symptoms and is a presumptive case.She refuses to stop attending. She and my dad are both in the high risk group. I explained that asymptomatic people can spread this, and that all it takes is one person in that group to inadvertently spread it to everyone else. Didn't make a difference. Though I did just see that Trump is saying to avoid groups of more than 10 people, so maybe now she'll listen 🙄 I work in an outpatient clinic as well. No PPE available.  It’s on backorder until the end of April.  Doctors are shutting down the office tomorrow and only doing virtual visits.  I support this 100%.  I’d rather lose my job and my paycheck then lose my life or be the reason why another person loses theirs.  My husband is going to work in critical care ONLY IF he has access to N95s.  It’s not hard to see that sick or dead nurses and doctors can’t help anyone.  I don’t understand why individuals voluntarily give up their rights, it only makes the situation worse for everyone. Personal Protective Equipment. Read: Mask/respirator, gloves. Personal Protective Equipment. In this case, referring to masks, face shields, gloves and isolation gowns. Personal Protective Equipment I bought a P100 mask, protects the same as N95 but includes oils, reusable, you can decon it, and currently I haven't seen any shortages of the masks or filter inserts. Also much more comfortable thus more likely to be used.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24011377/ Removed due to Rule 2 Bro that means \"Dipshit tourist\" What is PPE? Improper PPE = unsafe working conditions = right to protest.  Especially during a pandemic when my lack of PPE means that I could potentially infect dozens of others.  To be clear, the teachers didn’t actually strike. They just organized to make it happen if absolutely necessary.  In the same way, healthcare workers could organize to demand access to the national stockpiles of PPE NOW.  And not wait until there are 1000s of us sick and dying as patients on the very units were supposed to staff.... No. 1 rule of ems - don't give somebody else TWO people to save I support any nurse in refusing to work unless they are provided proper PPE.  Period.Edit: spelling austria here. we completed the shutdown today, only providing emergency care now, discharged as many patients as possible. working hour restrictions are suspended, we'll go back to 36h+ shifts and we reduced staff at the hospital to about 20% for now, although i don't expect this to last long. we'll start working in small teams (2 -3 people) from tomorrow on to reduce the impact of quarantine measures. while we are supposed to be the last hospital to treat covid cases in the city, the doubling rate is alarmingly high (\\~2.3 days) and we expect a surge sometime next week. pretty surreal feeling right now. I thought there were some in Singapore?  ICU nurse here, we have been lotted to one mask per day if patient is regular droplet (flu/mycoplasm,RSV;etc.) When the patient is POI (person of interest - suspected covid19) we treat them as droplet and are able to throw away masks after use. Only until confirmed positive are we allowed to use face shields, BUT with only a droplet mask still.   Our hospital did not prepare and is trying to order masks late in the game. 10 ICU staff have been sent home on quarantine leave primarily nurses and respiratory.  ICU doctor stated he expects to get sick and would rather get it over with and take up a hospital bed now before it gets terrible. Wash ur hands muh dudes. Not to mention they may not be able to come back home! Then they'll be interviewed on TV as casualties of the terrible lockdown. Gfy! So what does this mean clinically? Like my new ankle tattoo? It means WISDM in Chinese Do you have a link to the sheet you mentioned? I remembered seeing this mentioned (death after a patient appears to recover) but couldn't remember where and wasn't able to find it. Thanks There has been a lot of coverage of this - it was even asked in the White House press conference today. In the legislation being passed, they are trying to allow N95 masks that were made for construction etc by 3M to be used for medical work. They have a LOT more of these - and are making 30 million a month just at 3M. Unfortunately, Congress moves slowly. But expect this to be passed this week and see some supply improvement through an infusion of these masks. Shouting out my RTs forever they've saved my ass so many times when my pt is trying to die on me or something. Love when they show up when I'm in a crunch. Thanks! Fury warrior... Yeah, that's the US. Oh my goodness. Our respiratory therapists are not forgotten over here. You all roam the halls and have had my patients' backs time and time again and I am confident that y'all will have my back through this pandemic as well. We are a team. All of us. And we are strong, capable, and will make it through this thanks to all of our combined expertise and continued willingness to serve. ✊ Proper translations wouldn't look as cool on a license plate and removes the appeal of \"ooh, Asian proverb much wisdom.\" Keep in mind that a lot of healthcare org inertia comes from heavy baggage around things like regulation and billing that are directed rigidly from the top (i.e. government) down or by other outside factors. [Some places are reporting it in bits and pieces but not getting enough traction?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html)Edited to add that there's a quick mention or 2 of respirators in the article but no real mention of the reality some HCWs are facing. This is exactly what I have heard from other providers in outpatient clinics. I don’t do critical care or anything but like... surely at the point that you’re reusing masks and gloves to that extent you might as well not use PPE? I can’t tell if I’m in the minority for finding this disturbing. i have come to realize that the space between my nose and my upper lip looks ridiculous. This goes for your friendly neighborhood clinical engineering techs that receive the call to fix your monitor that's showing a low battery / won't stop beeping / can't get patient information in too. PPE, protect yo' neck, 100%. Thanks, that's a great article I will definitely analyze in depth.  My boss had asked about a splitter, so that's something I can definitely forward on. [deleted] Just so I'm clear what you're suggesting, you want healthcare workers to strike until hospitals close? During a pandemic? [removed] Minutes to hours, for damage.  But it sounds like you're very in tune with the granular need to control this, and you should reach out to your local hospital or the academic center nearest you to speak to the Pulm/Critical Care docs there. I'm a spoiled rotton community EM physician who doesn't have to care for boarded vented ICU patients, so it's been about 5 years since I've thought very seriously about any of this.  But here's a great well written link to a smart EM/Critical Care blog piece about the implications of messing around with vents which may serve your purposes.   He's coming at it from the idea of splitting a vent between two patients and what that would mean.  (This was actually done on the fly to help trauma patients survive the Las Vegas mass shooting event, which is very different medically as those are young patients not presumed to have lung disease or infectious illness who could be matched up by approx lung volume and had no unusual concerns about lung compliance or oxygenation).   [https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/) Are there any risks of that being hard to come up with or taking more than say a year? I am sure that would be an excellent business now. And really useful for countries to follow up the spread and immunity and establish how well the strategies are working. We're hearing from the Italians that lung compliance tends to be good. Same deal here. Additionally asked not to bring trauma teams into CT area - send 1 person and leave everyone else behind. I agree with you that it's scary and dangerous. The problem is, us not wanting to expose ourselves won't magically make PPE appear. There's a global shortage. This isn't a situation where strike action (formal or informal) means we can influence leaders and effect change to make it safer. Anyone without risk factors refusing to work with the (suboptimal) PPE we have is just increasing the strain on the system. I'm not saying any individual has to do it if they don't want to, but don't mistake it for stupidity or a lack of awareness in colleagues who choose to still work as one of the least worst options available. My mother isn't quite Goop level but is attracted to natural remedies like a toddler with bubbles.  I find this article to be very helpful - an MD integrative medicine specialist, but the good kind, and it goes in depth about how we need to first of all make certain that our natural remedies don't interfere with evidence based care, and then appeases her by going into depth about various herbs and stuff.    [https://avivaromm.com/covid-19-natural-prevention/?fbclid=IwAR2VAOyV8sutUhMiekVOpFSkeIIMDrGpw7CX2EDOl2VxKbnMXJ8IpaAUlV4](https://avivaromm.com/covid-19-natural-prevention/?fbclid=IwAR2VAOyV8sutUhMiekVOpFSkeIIMDrGpw7CX2EDOl2VxKbnMXJ8IpaAUlV4) Let us know what conditions are like. Teachers planned a sick out in NYC and suddenly the schools closed, RNs need to follow. Why are all proverbs translated without grammar? \"Saving a doctor saves lives.\" Gonna find out tonight. I almost got into an argument with a friend who told me she got a hold of 100 masks and that it wasn't her fault that others weren't prepared for this while she was amassing 4-6 weeks of food for herself and her son. I told her if anything please donate the extra masks. Meanwhile, yeah, this. Reusing masks and gowns and everything, that's so unsafe for the staff. Ughhhh I'm always jealous of the US. I wish we had respiratory therapists here, I don't think people here recognise how important good vent settings are to a patients outcome I'm expected to manage medications, cares and the ventilator in Australia. It's sad but they won't listen because that hot topic they're spewing hot garbage about is what keeps the listener captivated. It'd be nice to silence the uninformed but alas, the means are not there at this time. [deleted] RN here. PPE shortages are REAL.  Why isn’t the media all over this?  Yes there aren’t enough ventilators...but my local hospital sent out an email informing all clinical staff that they are to wear THE SAME SURGICAL MASK for days or weeks until it is visibly soiled or broken...N95s under lock and key.  What are the conditions like in your hospital/facility? What about reusing surgical masks and gloves between patients for an entire day? As in, taking them on and off? I'm curious about the myocarditis secondary to COVID-19. What is its onset relative to time of exposure/onset of symptoms? Have there been any predictors for who has gotten it? Any effective treatments? Yeah. I've submitted it as a text post to the subreddit, hopefully more people can see it that way.The full report is really something. Excellent, thank you. Key points from the summary:&gt; We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. Mitigation works, but not well enough.&gt;Suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \\[...\\] will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. Suppression is of course optimal from a purely epidemiological perspective, but can we bear the costs of shutting down huge parts of our economy for an extended period of time?Looking forward to reading the full report when I have time, great find. &gt; (emphasis mine) I've had a **chest pressure almost like you feel like you've done a big chest workout**. I've had a little bit of a cough. I had a relatively mild fever. I've had kind of weird aches and pains in places I'm not used to. But honestly, I feel like I've had colds and flus worse than this. **I've never been totally out for the whole day in bed.** I've been up, able to talk with people. So for me, luckily, it's been quite mild.Considering it's not ARDS, yes it might be mild COVID19 but that sounds pretty severe in my professional opinion, lol I'm not doing telehealth, but my understanding was that for medicare you use E&amp;M codes + a telehealth modifier, though im not sure the modifier, 95, GT, or something else. I caught that. I meant \"keep going\" with the other spelling mishaps, but it's not your job. Me? I work in the \"a/an\" pet-peeve department. i know..........dont do it Right?? I dont understand the logic of these patients. Also frustrated at my residency program for not taking it more seriously and only allowing urgent appointments at our clinic. Infuriating. There’s no discharge in the war Yes! I want to tweet it. There’s such a huge medical presence in Twitter. Just not sure how easy it is to track and fire me. &gt; _sighs_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should.Fuck Trump and his shithole administrration. (from an american) YES. As Koreans been saying, SAVE DR SAVE LIFE. Applies to other health prof ofc. isnt it enraging? It sounds like there are pretty considerable reasons why the rads residents can't work from home. I dunno, I feel more concern for the EM/gas/ICU fellows who have to be exposed to aerosolized secretions to be honest. Here's the data underlying the UK government's response - and they've modelled the US as well. This is the report that has resulted in the UK's latest social distancing measures.Highlights include: deaths in the US of approximately 1 million people. Peak demand more than 8x greater ICU surge capacity in both the US and UK. Any social distancing measures must be in place until a vaccine is disseminated.Report 9https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/ I think our best guess at this comes from comparing the curves of the pace at which new cases were identified.  I found one graph that implies we have tried to establish quarantine a few days ahead of where Italy was, which sounds hopeful.  On the other hand, they have more hospital beds per capita than we do, which is depressing.  \"your laying in a hospital bed\" Just correcting my pet peeve ;) Keep going... Very well worded comment. It might just save lives. All of the coronavirus-related articles on NY times site are free but you'll have to create an account. Hope this helps. Looking at this article, the design I'm envisioning would follow the \"biphasic ventilation\" model seen about 2/3 the way down this link.  It'd be a disposable connection set that would take advantage of an existing intermitting suction regulator and a positive pressure source to create the alternation needed for breathing. Both pressures would be fully adjustable by clinicians.  So while there'd be no automation available, it might be manageable if there were enough hands but not enough ventilators.https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/304068-overview#a7What timescale does the harm you're referring to occur across? It could sort of fit under the code blue admonishment of checking your own pulse first. I agree it would’ve explicitly been in there if it were more timely. EXACTLY. If we can give front line workers extra time to fix the shortages of PPE and critical care equipment, we're helping them (which means saving not only their lives, but their patients as well) Have there been any studies/surveys showing that HCWs actually are getting higher rates of severe disease? I agree. As a radiology resident, I'm OK with my attendings--many of whom are much older than me--staying home and working from there rather than risk getting infected. We might need some attendings for any urgent procedures, but otherwise, us seniors can handle a lot on our own.And like Boomboomgel said, home reading stations are expensive. You should not use just any old computer monitor, for example, as they may not provide the adequate luminance and resolution for optimal diagnostic decisions. Further details are available in the ACR-AAPM-SIIM Technical Standard for Electronic Practice of Medical Imaging. Good advice. Thank you. It's probably important to remember scale. 0.2% is still 60,000 20-35 year olds dead at 50% saturation. That doesn't even account for hospitalizations or long term lung damage. That’s fair. Good points. I’ve got no problem with someone putting an amethyst in their shoe or whatever, as long as that person is taking other precautions. Unfortunately, this kind of balanced, dual approach does not appear to be the norm. Paywall for me? New meta-analysis of of Covid-19 out on preprint. Key findings: dyspnoea key predictive symptom for ICU admission and severe disease; COPD, cardiovascular disease and hypertension also predictive.https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1 Any links or texts that explain the minutiae of it I could look into? No antibody tests currently but I’m sure there will be in the future Just took a knee for you I agree, both these cases surpassed my expectation of mild I'm sorry, you absolutely are and vital! ahh enjoy your comp! Best type of vacation cause no guilty feelings for turning into a complete potato. Though I have to clean up, the state of my apartment is.... well, nightshift mess. It was actually my first time working nightshift ever. Yeah. I wonder what the world will look like in 2 weeks... or a month? How our daily lives will look like... German study N=9 of viral shedding characteristics in confirmed Covid patients. Very high viral load early in illness, approx 1000 times greater than SARS. At DAY 8 of active symptoms, no longer able to detect active virus in samples, only viral RNA. Only viral RNA in feces, never detected active virus.They're following up now with N=23 cohort.[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1) I mean the ED is about to go completely bonkers. The EM docs already don't like the turn around time for scans. I suppose outpatient imaging will be down so hopefully that'll make up for the increase in volume. They absolutely *will* fire people.  Hospitals are not run by doctors, they’re run by businessmen. This is exactly how I feel and I am so frustrated. I told him he just needs to wear a mask for each patient. If they run out don’t go in because it’s not worth it for anyone - his patients, his family, his own health given his age and HPN Dynamic control of volume and pressure are required, these are both moving targets that progress as the illness evolves over a few days and under or over doing it causes real harm Well they don't have home reading stations, for starters. Those stations are very expensive. But also radiologists do perform procedures, go down to the ED on occasion for various things related to the scans like consenting people and such. And it leaves the PGY5s kind of out there, in that they'll be the primary folks supervising the PGY4-2s. So it'll be like it is when they're on call except it's during the day and during a pandemic. IDK, I'm probably just being irritable. To me it just seems like if from a nursing standpoint all the charge nurses and nurse managers were just like \"Ok guys, good luck! I'll be available by telephone if you need me!\" Anybody have thoughts on how to best utilize home health services if we end up getting a bed crunch?  If people are just requiring supplemental O2 would it not be reasonable to try for early discharge and home management? There are so many things going on at our institution that are making me uncomfortable also. This is not going to go well. This makes a lot of sense While I agree with what you are saying, it’s unfortunate that Respiratory Therapists weren’t mentioned when we are just as on the front lines as you nurses. We’ll be intubating these people. And managing their vents. I don’t have the links at hand but there is a pdf on the CDC website and there are videos from Britain’s NHS out there. Both are good. Also, simply searching YouTube videos from trusted sources (med centers, government agencies, etc) is what I’ve been telling people to do. Anyone doing telehealth in Primary care?  How are you doing your visit coding?I think this is the correct CMS referrence but it is listing codes like 99215.  Does it need a modifier to indicate telelhealth?https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/TelehealthSrvcsfctsht.pdf so if it's old people and attractive young people, does that mean I'm excluded from getting the virus lol *you're You get the local DA office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. this was posted previously:https://emcrit.org/ibcc/covid19/#personal_protective_equipment_(PPE) Probably reporting (media) bias. If there's 100 cases,  99 older and 1 attractive young person,  who is the media going to report on? Not saying it doesn't happen,  but these rare cases do seem to be circulated a lot more than the standard ones. I'm guessing the fury warrior pulled aggro. Honestly, minimizing risk for ANY healthcare worker is imperative at this moment. Why risk infecting a radiologist who can provide diagnostic support during the coming surge from afar? Unless I’m mistaken, is it essential that they are present in the hospital during the outbreak? We need all hands on deck but that can come in many forms. Unnecessary exposure will just cause more spread and more problems.  You get the local attorney office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. Why can't residents work from home Exactly. We've not even begun the war against covid, so to speak and we're already dangerously low of PPE. It's reassuring to hear from a fellow colleague with a level head. We need to be protecting ourselves first, and not act heroic and kill ourselves and in turn, other colleagues and patients. OURS. Thanks. We're out here on the front line with no rapid testing and no PPE. There's no other industry in *existence* that would be asked to work under those conditions. You stay home to slow this thing down until someone figures out how to properly protect health care employees.It's the LEAST we deserve for taking this burden on. Glad to see some action in major cities. I'm in NYC, and the streets are getting a bit emptier but not as empty as I hoped. There's still quite a few people commuting to work and hanging out in groups. Public schools are closed and transitioning to online learning until April 20, universities have moved online for the foreseeable future and some have kicked students out of dorms. Restaurants and bars are either closed or takeout/delivery only - many are struggling trying to pay their employees. Nightclubs, movie theaters, and concert venues are closed. We have a covid patient who presented as presumed STEMI later determined to be likely viral myocarditis. My hospital is wasting N95 masks on elective cases today.We’ve been told over and over - “business as usual”Our elective surgeries continue to flow in. And now, due to concern about ‘aerosolization’, OR staff are being told to wear N95 masks for some of these cases.So to recap - still doing elective cases. Burning through N95 masks.Does anyone know if I can make an anonymous Twitter handle and tweet about this without getting doxed? The system here is already fucked because we don't even have enough PPE. We absolutely need to slow down the spread. What characteristics of a ventilator are critical to their function that this would miss?  I know not having them electronically follow the patients' breathing patterns is not ideal, but it would seem something that forced them into a regular 4 second breathing pattern would be a better than nothing.  I'm talking in a scenario like Italy has where some patients are simply not getting any respiratory support due to a shortage of equipment.  Adding negative pressure rooms to our list. My hospital system is treating everyone with respiratory symptoms as droplet precautions from now until ? LEEEERRROOOOYYYYYYYYYY Neither of these cases seem mild to me, and certainly not enough to blame on a gym workout! Mild enough to blow off to me is a day or two of sore throat and sniffles and back to normal. Sure, but his comment didn't specify that those things weren't taken into account. People with asthma don't necessarily get more severe illness with this strain according to some of the preliminary data. There is not nearly enough data to give you much more than that. one trillion upvotes- more of my questions answered How many lives? This is great. Would you be up for reposting this as a separate thread for maximum exposure? Ha I also have comp after night shift this week. I’m supposed to be in clinic next week but I have no idea what that will look like. Kite them!  Kite them! As a healthcare worker with asthma and also I'm fat, how fucked am I?  Other than using recommended PPE, any recommendations?  Nursing staff ain't always the healthiest bunch.Edit: I'm on a med surg floor once a week. &gt; EDIT: how can I explain to my father that he needs to tell the office manager that it does not make sense to only wear a mask after you’ve been in contact with a patient with COVID-19 and everyone should be wearing one when interacting with patients?You can't fix stupid China did, then I'm not sure if a hunter misdirected, or someone ran away from the group, but theres adds everywhere now What a pisspoor idea. I feel like they are leaving the residents out to dry. Look into how to create negative pressure rooms.  We need a lot more than we have, and working at a suction device manufacturer makes you keenly suited to the task.  Good luck! I personally haven't seen stats that say otherwise. It simply seems the quantity of elderly facing this disease is far overshadowing the numbers in younger people.Percentage wise, younger people are less at risk, but the risk is still non-zero (and seemingly much higher than the flu). Good bot. My department is having daily town hall meetings. Via Microsoft Teams (virtual town hall). pull the fire alarm before it starts? &gt;.&lt; seriously, try to send the message up the chain how bad of an idea that is. We suspended all stuff like that two weeks or so ago. Why are you pissed? It is reddit, you are American until proven otherwise :pbut yeah... unfortunately the global trend seems to follow the US atm... \\_sighs\\_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should. A lot of churches are doing their services online which is smart. Sounds more like constant emergency 24/7. I'm not jealous of them. But I respect the fuck out of their work! Here’s another interesting first hand account of a mild case from someone with confirmed pcr:https://www.facebook.com/EbethBerkeley/posts/10110434821081713Claimed symptoms paint an interesting picture Hahahaha I did not notice that! I am so not correcting that... On the [This Week in Virology podcast](http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) prof Ralph Baric had the intriguing hypothesis that the endemic human coronaviruses that cause the common cold could have been very serious sars like diseases for adults when initially introduced from animals. This would have the implication that the only reason they are not deadly now is that we develop immunity from exposure as children and then get mild disease as adults when re-infected. If this is true then SARS-2 will eventually become the 3rd human coronavirus that causes just the common cold in people.A highly recommended listen! &gt; Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.Hopefully in a few months we'll have a better handle (more PPE, more vents, more beds, more knowledge, more treatment options) on this than we do now... Buying time saves lives. Your message is *super* important, and will hopefully help keep people alive.In a previous era of life, I had a long and full career in law enforcement.  I used to teach new, young, gung-ho academy graduates that when you're responding to an emergency call, a crime in progress, etc., with lights and siren going, to do the following:  Drive only a small, reasonable bit above the speed limit, and maybe at or below the speed limit.  Stop at every single red light and stop sign.  Completely stop.  Wait a second or three.  Look around. Make sure everyone has stopped for you.  *Then* go through it and continue on.   Don't drive faster than the sound from your siren.  Stay far enough back from traffic you're coming up to and be patient to let them have time to hear your siren and notice your lights in their mirror(s) and get out of your way.You **must** be wearing your bulletproof vest, **every** day, no matter the duty, location, season, temperature, humidity, etc.You **must** get out of your car slowly.  Look around for traffic.  Look around for people.  Stand still and listen.  Wait.  Stand still and listen and look longer.  Then walk slowly to where you need to go, while looking all around.You can't help anyone if you don't arrive where the help is needed, and if you don't arrive there safe, healthy, alive, prepared, **and protected**.Keep broadcasting this, and stay safe during this, please. I know you meant \"re-exposed\" but somehow \"re exploded\" is just as fitting :( It's very sad, but it's not a direct pathology of the disease. The thought would be “are you kidding me” WHOAH WHO SAID I WAS REFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES?! Just messing.... I was :( Luks? Yeah we are not there yet (USB). They are starting to cancel electives and have said that we can be moved to other duties. I will be reading up on relevant things this week (I have comp week after a week of nightshift). Honestly don't know what I'll be returning to next week. Referral specialist for an HMO here - still getting a ton of referrals for non-urgent issues.  I'm a little dumbfounded at how many people want to see the doctor right now for their moles or their genetic testing...you know, the things that can wait 2 weeks?  Very frustrating to see. Yes. My girlfriend is from Texas and I am so glad that 1st I was born here and 2nd I was finally able to bring her here last summer. Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now. My husband is all \"Eh, shit rolls downhill\" but I'm pissed. Is this the norm in radiology departments elsewhere during this crisis? https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/tagesschau-spezial/video/medienkonferenz-des-bundesrates-zum-coronavirus?id=6329d7d0-e1e9-4221-a091-3dbba7b7fd43here (in German/French/Italian/Romantsch obv). Skip to 5:00 to hear the opening speech.  It feels. Warm. I rarely feel like I am part of something, but rn I kinda do. I hesitate to say \"proud\" because it isn't like I did anything for it. Relief knowing that our government actually tries to help the people.   You have to understand the difference in system. The executive branch is the federal council, consisting of 7 members distributed proportionally to the share of vote that the parties got. So there are right and left wing and center people in there but they always speak with one voice towards the outside. There is no party politics involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland) if you wanna read some about it) Or the hospital will give it to them.....my hospital just came out with the same policy to continue Spain was partying a week ago while Italy was starting to be ravaged.  Now they know and are trying to tell us to do the same.Icarus..... Anyone got a good presentation about Proper ppe for covid 19? Or any good source. Much Appreciated. They don't care. Our CMO sent out an email saying electives will go on. It was replied to by the President and CEO congratulating her for not falling into the \"hype\". This is a large, multi state regional enterprise/level 1 trauma center.  Hope none of the dozen+ cataract cases or hundred other electives brought us a surprise thank you gift today. Must be nice to have a government that puts its people above politics Okay but who's tanking this boss? [deleted] ### Removed under Rule 4:Link to original research and provide sources when required.

If you've got fifteen 20-40 year old in critical condition it looks bad even if they're less than half a percent of those infected. &gt; Also great somber speech of our president. She emphasized the important points in all 4 languages.I wonder what this feels like.Good to hear, thanks for sharing. They've already said that they're not out to maximise the infection rate to create herd immunity.They seem more worried about compliance with measures if they are in place longer than they have to be. Ah sorry. And yes, I'm a millennial too and seeing the same thing you are. Plus having to explain to my mother why she shouldn't be having all her friends over for dinner and drinks. SMH It's in all ages and demographics. I'm afraid we've been protected by good medicine for so long that people just don't understand how harsh nature can be. Alright folks, less Q Q. More pew pew. Then you don't go in, unless you've made your peace with never coming back out. And as noted further down the thread: \"When the healers are dead, *everyone* is dead.\" Yup, mentioned a couple posts back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fijfir/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_13th_2020/fkhhd0j/) but definitely bears repeating. I inserted the symptom distribution in English in my original reply. I really don't know why the [English version](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-03-15-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) of the status report does leave out the symptoms while keeping regional and age distribution. Edit: Also, are you named after the medieval Sterntor in Bonn? Except flame wreath, never for flame wreath. I posted this to my Instagram/Snapchat to remind my friends in medicine. We can’t help others if we don’t keep ourselves safe. Crazy thought but... http://StayFuckingHome.com What if we have no more PPE? 😓 Should be avoided. I am a millennial 😂.  So many people on my Facebook groups are traveling and posting pictures in bars etc.  agree.  Idiots in every age group. Sorry, I don't buy that. The message has been consistent for at least a couple of weeks. Nobody has ever gave contrary information to social distancing. I also live in Canada where we essentially receive the exact same media and facebook feeds. People believe what they want to believe. Those who want to party on St Patty's will tell themselves it's just a flu. Any thoughts on an institution having town hall meetings in a large hospital everyday this week and encouraging any and all employees to attend? Right?  *Move* first and then DPS.  It's not that hard! That's what I'm personally worried about. I'm in disbelieve about how my facility is handling this. I love my job, I've always said we're the best facility. No special type of compensation if you're quarentined. Works comp covers 66% after 8 days. ( in assuming this is 8 shifts? No one can answer this question. So pretty much no pay for the whole two weeks ) and that's only if its directly linked to a patient who tests positive. Our DOH is refusing many test requests. We're running out of PPE. Schools are closed and many people are having childcare issues. [Position Statement of the ESC Council on Hypertension on ACE-Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers. In the context of COVID-19.](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang)\"13 Mar 2020Based on initial reports from China, and subsequent evidence that arterial hypertension may be associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 infected subjects, hypotheses have been put forward to suggest a potential adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). It has been suggested, especially on social media sites, that these commonly used drugs may increase both the risk of infection and the severity of SARS-CoV2. The concern arises from the observation that, similar to the coronavirus causing SARS, the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs. Because of the social media-related amplification, patients taking these drugs for their high blood pressure and their doctors have become increasingly concerned, and, in some cases, have stopped taking their ACE-I or ARB medications.This speculation about the safety of ACE-i or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scientific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is no data in humans.The [Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)) wish to highlight **the lack of any evidence**supporting harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.The Council on Hypertension **strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the Covid-19 infection.** *Prof. Giovanni de Simone,**Chair, ESC Council on Hypertension**On behalf of the Nucleus Members\"* I'm not sure what to believe... we have so many reports of young people critically ill, but stats say otherwise... what do you guys think? Obviously this is a question everyone has People need to stop standing in fire I know. It's a terrible situation. World-changing situation. I really don't know what the world is going to look like in a year. &gt; We're being threatenedI'm not in the US and this is a terrible situation they are putting you in, but they are not going to fire medical staff with this going on.  Stand firm and get your colleagues to stand firm, insist on the PPE or walk out until it's there.  As the post above says you can't help anyone for the time you're down with the virus (or dead) If you're refusing report because you don't have proper PPE, I believe you'd win the argument. If you're refusing because you're scared, you'd probably lose. In my community, it's the boomers who are flippant about this and think it won't affect them. I just got into it today with one of them about closing her yoga studio and deleting her posts about how wellness based lifestyle can prevent illness... Just to say, please don't turn this into an Us vs Them thing. There are idiots in all age groups. Yep. Analyzing clinical presentation and symptoms does not work well for us. The very first patient tested positive at our ER had nothing more than a sore throat and got tested because he attended a carnival attend which became infamous for spread (at a point where there were still no cases). Guy was a homework tutor at an elementary school, luckily of over 220 tested children and parents none positive but this could have easily gone south if the ER didn't fish him out.  This is all public information revealed in press conferences and articles at this point, if you are concerned about confidentiality. Awesome information! This is just what I was looking for. Now I just need to brush up on my German. Same here lol. Came in this morning and noticed that quite a few of us had shaved clean over the weekend, the initial shock as we saw each other’s beardless faces after years was great. I think they release in the early afternoon (EST). They're going to be spooked by the large increase of +2000 cases since their last sitrep. WHO pulls their US numbers from [CDC's page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html), which is reporting just over 1600 cases while the actual number of positives [sits at over 4100](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en).P.S. The second link compiles data from various health department sites and breaks it down by state and county. More detailed reports can be found further down the page. If any mods are reading, I think it's worth a sticky. Does anyone have any experience with appropriate coding/encounter type/billing for telephone encounters? This would be for patients calling for COVID rule-out/guidance as well as possibly folks who have needs that could be met without an in-person visit.Trying to help with an institutional response in a rural area. Thanks! The amount of bull shit I hear from radio hosts in the car is astounding. It’s more mild than the flu, it’s the media, it’s a left wing political move. It’s insane that these people are even allowed to make comments about it. I’ve tried to call in to at least warn them that they should leave those kinds of statements to people in the medical field without luck. &gt; Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown?What's the goal behind \"shut everything down\"?  Realistically, we are not going to get the infection rate to 0 even if we shut everything down for a couple months.  Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.  The time where a total shutdown is needed is if we get into an Italy or Wuhan situation where the system is overrun.  Then it makes sense to knock the infections down to a point where they can be handled.The changes that need to be made are the ones that slow the spread while normal life continues.  Shutting everything down is a delaying tactic and not a permanent solution Oh.  Oh boy. I hadn’t been clean shaven in a decade. I look like a high schooler. The inevitable ingrown hairs while my skin adjusts will really complete the teenager look. Here's the [CDC guidelines for breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fpregnancy-faq.html) as a person with known or suspected covid 19. That might be helpful as you're trying to figure out the best course of action. Thanks so much for mentioning more possible symptoms to look out for! Thanks so much! :) Why hasn't WHO released a daily sitrep today? Pardon the really weird analogy from video games.Something I learned playing MMORPGs - We have a bit of wisdom when 20+ people are fighting bosses:\"Dead Damage Dealers do no damage. Dead Healers do no healing.\"The throughput of those alive are infinitely better than those who are dead (or incapacitated). It is not worth that extra bit of throughput if it will cost your life. Contributions will be much greater alive than dead.It is totally the turtle and the hare situation, except instead of the hare slacking off, it's the hare being sick.EDIT: To add - \"When the Healers are dead, everyone is dead.\" Real Life Healthcare Professionals, take care of yourselves. You're too important to lose. We're being threatened, the union is trying but getting stonewalled. It doesn't help the CDC keeps changing the recommendations. Who do we believe! The Chinese in ground zero wearing HazMat? Or the CDC who ( and this may have changed now, hopefully, without my knowledge ) was only letting one company manufacturer COVID19 Tests??I asked what would happen if we refused to accept report on assignments with a COVID19 patient and I haven't gotten an answer. Thank you for being human and trying to help out. I don't think your ventilator idea would work, however if your machines can create negative pressure rooms that would be greatly needed. Thanks! I appreciate it. : ) Math is a thing used by epidemiologists, who take into account important things like disease latency, incubation periods, true incidence vs. apparent incidence, etc.Nothing about math teaches you that. Only the other way around. I’m about to shave mine. I’m a new attending and look like a med student without it. Working on the ED I don’t think it’s feasible to use the PAPR that often for the number of people I’m gonna have to put on BiPAP or tube.Question: are we now assuming every COPD exacerbation has COVID-19 until proven otherwise? Called to a code last night (pharmacist). Our boss said we shouldn’t go to codes of COVID patients bc we are non essential and need to save PPE. We are told to keep the med drawer of the cart outside the room along with rsi kit and hand meds in. I’m not sure what that is going to look like. Last night I asked if isolation patient and the response I got was “not yet”. Arrested at home after a couple days cheat pain. So I go to the code and the MD is fully PPE covered, mask and face shield. No one else is. I’m wondering- are ED physicians just wearing garb the whole shift? I can’t imagine keeping it on and walking from room to room but I am not up there full time so I don’t know. Yah but what are healthcare professionals suppose to do with the lack of prep? The people voted for this current administration... I hope for nurses and doctors sake that they strike after all this. Hard too. They are put at unnecessary risk because of our current state of healthcare. Should be done, thanks for the reminder! I suggest we add an exception to rule #10 specifically for [reacting to healthcare workers who've had to shave :(](https://giphy.com/gifs/afv-americas-funniest-home-videos-26vUN2RR48dddT1Cg) You do not see patients until you get any. You close down until you do. You can not put yourself at risk. this needs its own thread.. Yes, the number of antecdotal reports is alarming. As of yesterday, the German national status report of the RKI has 3024 cases with full clinical data. Only 39% of these positive tested patients presented with fever! (Source in German: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-03-15-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) I agree 1,000% with you. Just yesterday one of my good friends announced to me that he and two others are taking a road trip south. Mind you they work in NYC, and mind you that just on Saturday they attended a party with 10+ nurses who work at a hospital with confirmed covid. I tried explaining why it was an absolutely horrible and selfish idea to go at this time. He responded \"points taken\" and today I got a picture from a friend of a friend of them on the road. I still can't fucking believe it. I never understood how arrogant and selfish the average American is. What do we do if our hospital has no more P.P.E. What criteria are CDC using for \"recovery\"? There was an internist cheat sheet I saw the other day from Italy that described the above. It basically said don’t trust the first patient rally. I believe a lot of our ignorance is due to the fact of information overload. There are thousands upon thousands of people telling us to do X or Y. One physician says wear masks, another says don’t. Things like these take a toll on the regular American Citizen. Also anyone can post on the internet. Those on the corona subreddit. Or news. Or world news. Are their posts always true? Nope but it’s not like it matters. The moderators on the forums (not even exclusively Reddit), are they healthcare professionals? Nah probably not. Then we turn to the administration, are they professionals? Nah. No, that's not how epidemiology works. If it did, epidemiology wouldn't exist. State of emergency for all of Switzerland. All non-essential stores and public venues closed. Strongly suggested to stay home. Home office if at any way possible. For risk population wages are guaranteed even if home office is not an option. Army will be deployed to help hospitals. Call for all Swiss abroad on vacation to come home. Closing of the borders for non-essential travel.I almost cried. Finally. Also great somber speech of our president. She emphasized the important points in all 4 languages. With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.  So in theory while you would have unlimited resources and be in full PPE the reality is going to be healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should. I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required. My wife is an ER physician and we have a 4 week old baby. She will likely be returning to work earlier than planned due to the virus.  We are hoping she can stay out at least a few more weeks.Stay safe everyone. Humanity's arrogance. Shit like this has happened everywhere. Just look at the members of that church/cult? in SK. We are seeing lots of exhaustion, depression, even suicide in stressed out systems.  I know nothing about this particular case, but non COVID causes are certainly plausible. Agree Hmm. If that is Covid that would be an entirely new presentation.... Myocarditis and arrest is becoming more reported, and more commonly how young folks are dying I am literally in an argument with my best-friend cousin about whether or not this is a big deal. She lives in DC, I live in Seattle. She is not listening to me. She is angry her son is missing 2 weeks of school. I'm worried I might be homeless in 6 months. Or dead. But those are healthy, compliant lungs. Totally different if you have intrinsic lung disease.It may still come to it, but don’t expect miracles. The wonderful thing about math is that it can be checked by anyone who knows their stuff. Maybe this \"chucklehead\" is a crank, maybe not, but unless you're good at math and have checked their numbers yourself, your dismissal of it seems like another form of anti-intellectualism to me. There were a lot of nerdy people ringing the alarm bell on this disease weeks before the mainstream picked up on it, and I saw a lot of this same \"who made you an expert?\" attitude among people who were in denial up until recently, or even still. I’m glad you’re taking this level of care in your planning. I like all your ideas. I know hospitals that aren’t this regimented! I have nothing to add but I’m so thankful for people like you who are taking it seriously. F [removed] My hypothesis is that the economy is on the verge of crumbling.&amp;#x200B; Businesses will go under, leading to layoffs, which will lead to less spending, which will lead to businesses going under,which will lead to layoffs, which will lead to less spending. Shall I continue?&amp;#x200B;V 2 of the hypothesis is that they are already aware they must scale back, however the markets are hyper-reactive and emotional so you cannot just announce ''we're stopping all flights, mandating all businesses closed and a curfew after 6pm\". The trump announcement on european travel ban created a massive drop in the market after hours.The worrying part is that once it comes out that the hospitals aren't able to help everyone, then we will see the true gruesome nature of this pandemic.It is right about that time people will realize ''oh jeez, more serious than I thought'' I would like a moment of silence for my facial hair - I am going to shave tonight. The one N95 mask I have been permitted to have for each clinical encounter in my clinic needs to do the best it can.I fear my daughter will not know who i am.If you have went back to looking like a teenager as I will soon do, please offer any words of comfort you may have. F Is there currently a way to test if you have had a previous infection by Covid-19? If not will it be possible in a close future? I figure this will be even more interesting in the coming weeks to understand how the herd immunity status is. And also when a lot of countries are only testing seriously ill patients. I assume the current tests only spill the news of a potential on-going infection? everyone will catch the shit out of this virus AFAIK all the hospitals in Seattle have put a stop those. I'm not even bothering to go see my ortho this week. No point now. &gt; For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis Hahaha!Shit. :( Call your governor’s office.  Local government.  Tell other parents to do the same.  The state superintendent’s office needs to hear your concerns! As a Seattlite, I love that idea. I hate what it means for our city, but I love that idea! she may need to pump and let you give that to them. uptodate mentions trying to be as careful as possible but i can't imagine how you avoid transmission during breastfeeding given the baby is directly in line with your respiration. &gt; But everything floating around is hearsay. We all need to remember that. I'm currently operating under the assumption of higher viral load for HCW causing higher rates of severe disease. All the more reason to adhere to strict PPE. States with any real numbers of cases are taking it seriously. I'm in WA and Inslee just closed entertainment places including bars and restaurants. All K-12 are closed, and colleges/unis are doing all online courses through April. I think we're heading for a huge global depression. We MIGHT get a new New Deal out of it, but let's be honest, we don't have much wiggle room right now. We're still in debt as a nation from the last crisis. &gt; IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. They're not, because they didn't get there using logic. You can't logic someone out of a position they hold due to feelings. Thank you! I remember working the ED for months from the floatpool during the Ebola outbreak. Quarantining half of it for dedicated use on presenting pts. No one panicked, but the hair on the back of your neck sure did raise every time that bell rang for new admission. Just remember, you can't help someone else if you're incapacitated. Stay strong everyone, and take care. I wish people in my fathers office would think this way. The CMO told them that until a provider is actually sick, you should keep seeing patients, even after being exposed to someone with the virus. I have to wonder how many other rural clinics are being this cavalier. &gt; But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.I keep trying to tell people on various subreddits that just because they're sick, that doesn't mean they need to be tested. I just keep getting downvoted. If you know they are exceeding the number limit, report them. They will at least get a nice big fine and hopefully not make idiotic choices again, plus the gathering will be broken up. This is so vitally important. It will require very active suppression of honed clinical muscle memories and learned responses. It will not be easy but it is the only way forward. He’s an elderly petulant child Hey there, I noticed previous threads are often automatically set sort by New, is there anyway to change this thread to do the same? (Thank you again for all you’ve done the past few weeks, and in general!) What are you talking about.  One of Trump's desperate staffers was able to grab his phone and make him tweet, \"Social Distancing!\"That'll make all of his dumb%#* followers fall in line right? &gt; I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it's pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though people still find a way...And Seattle has to keep dealing with that jackass [Tim Eyman](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/coronavirus-daily-news-update-march-14-what-to-know-today-about-covid-19-in-the-seattle-area-washington-state-and-the-nation/), calling for a gathering of \"250 patriots\" to flout Jay Inslee's ban on crowds. &gt;There is no emergency in a pandemic.If the book *House of God* took place during a pandemic, this would be one of the rules. Possibly an unpopular opinion.  If you choose to go out to bars or travel you should put your name on a list.  People on the list start at the bottom when it comes to the rationing of medical supplies.  If I’m self isolating and not doing anything risky, I should be able to get a vent before a millennial who doesn’t think their actions have consequences. If you were like me you saw tons of people out this weekend. I don’t think we did enough, soon enough. Closing restaurants and bars before the weekend would have really been great, but at this point you have to think it’s coming a little late. But better late than never. I've been asked to be part of a testing team and the biggest part of my thought process is my 3600 dollar deductible. It is sad that as a health care provider I have to worry about the massive bill that simply doing my job could end up delivering me. Yes, it seems to follow the pattern of looking well enough for discharge then tanking...i only hope there are enough clinicians out there who are aware to be on the lookout for this and can hopefully prevent some cases from slipping through. My mom is super religius and lives in San Diego (not very hard hit yet). Her church cancelled all activities as of last week. I'm VERY happy about that!Now if only Seattle could keep Tim Eyman away from the internet and the outside world for 3 months, that'd be great. Is there any large scale data on afebrile presentations of covid-19? There seems to be a belief in the general population that no fever=no coronavirus and much of the screening advice seems to focus around fever as well. [This article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article) describes two younger patients, one who was afebrile throughout the course of the disease and one who was febrile for only 3 days. Both had positive PCR results for at least 20 days. My mom and my RN aunt are harping on my elderly mom with COPD to stay away from people. I am not sure she's listening. But she's proud of me!!! Yay. Simplest answer: no one knows. We were likely too late but we will see in 10-14 days where we are. If we manage to make it through fairly unscathed as a nation then everything we have done will have worked but will be seen by the lay public as overreaction. If it doesn’t work and we end up in an Italy like situation, then I’m afraid the same public will say it didn’t matter what we did, it was gonna happen regardless. In my opinion, I feel that everyone in the country will directly know personal family with this disease. Stuff like that, given our population now, rarely happens. As stated this is just one guy’s opinion, though &gt; and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiologyThere's some chucklehead on /r/CoronavirusWA who keeps posting trend lines of infected and death rates. I asked him why he thought he had the expertise to draw any conclusions from that information, and he said \"I'm good at math.\" LOL ok dude. It's to flatten the curve, make sure that people don't all get sick at the same time and overwhelm the medical system.We're not stopping this. It's out there. We've just got to get through it and meet on the other side of it. She. But it would be a great name for her &gt; Dr actonFor just a second I thought his name was Dr. Action and I was like, \"Yeah, that's fitting!!\" I've always said that if I were an evil genius and wanted to eradicate a group of anti-vaxxers that the best intervention would be....convince them not to get vaccines. I think that Covid is the equivalent for anti government and anti-science groups. They will catch the shit out of this virus. Nothing in the news yet but a coworker of his facebooked about it; link to COVID is completely unknown at this time, he had not been known to be ill the day before. Simply found inexplicably dead. Medical device R&amp;D engineer here.  I work for a small suction regulator company  and we're trying to see if there's any way for us to help on the supply chain side.We're not equipped to help with high volume things like masks and other PPE, but one thing I keep seeing is a shortage of ventilators in the worst hit areas.  Could a low tech \"ventilator\" that oscillates between a specific positive pressure and a weakly negative pressure/atmospheric pressure be helpful at timed intervals be helpful in scenarios where there aren't enough ventilators go around? Are there any other things I should be looking into? Except of course the 50,000 who died. That is of course the problem with percentages is that it is pretty easy to have 18 times the people who died in the Iraq war and 9/11 when you turn it into a percentage. He already said he takes no responsibility We must spread this wisdom ASAP Engineering orgs are often more forward-thinking than healthcare orginazations, as someone who has worked in both That's not how people will look at it though.  It is:Option 1: 4.95% chance of death and a year+ disruption to economic and social life.Option 2: 5% chance of death and we get it over with in a few months.Pretty much everyone is going to take option 2. I also work for the NHS and have no intention of going down with the ship (if it's sinking due to lack of PPE).  If we run out of PPE, I am not going near Covid-19.  There are many stories of young healthcare workers getting very ill and dying from Covid even with PPE. It's scary and downright dangerous that the virus has barely scratched the NHS and many trusts are already running low on vital PPE. I'm currently reading PFTs (Pulm/CC Fellow) and trying to get my department to cancel all the PFTs and exercise tests. The only part of these that is closed to outside air is the lung volumes, so all these susceptible patients with COPD etc are going to be spraying droplets all over the room with a RT and sometimes a fellow who are going to be badly needed when shit hits the fan. Thanks for posting this. You’ve highlighted my thoughts exactly. The thing is, I (working for the NHS) don’t want to crash along with it. Nor do I want the NHS or the UK to crash, but that’s not something I can control! I have coworkers who are openly talking about having their own big at Patrick’s day party tomorrow at their house because all the bars are closed and in defiance of the 100 person limit in our state. Literally people who take care of sick trauma patients everyday but their St. Patrick’s day boozefest is more important and then I’m stuck being unable to prevent exposure or spread because they don’t care and I still have to show up to work and work next to them. What are all those naval mercy hospital ships up to?  Is it time to think about recalling them? I cant imagine parking a 1000 bed hospital outside of Seattle would be a bad idea right now. Sobering. Thank you. I\"m seeing this more in the context of people who regularly use NSAIDs. There's a lot of talk about stopping them because if you get sick it would make the sickness worse. For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis or something like that. Truly sobering. Under your scenario, every month we prolong the spread is worth up to 8,000 lives. If they willfully infect the entire population then a year's worth of ICU beds goes to waste, and up to 80,000 people die needlessly.  I really wish people would listen to medical professionals when they tell you lifestyle choices are the number one thing you can do to improve and maintain good health. Instead, many people do what they want and then,  when it hits the fan, they want a magic remedy. I hope In the future we spend more time learning and understanding as patients about public health and our responsibilities to care for ourselves. Fox is like crack cocaine. My coworker has been estranged by his son for several years because of it. He told me \"I'm addicted to it. I know that. I can't help it\". I thought it so bizarre he said that. Nothing conclusive (obviously, too early) but data from other coronaviruses indicate 2 year (not lifelong) immunity. I'm in love with Amy Acton. \"There are most definitely pros and cons to both\"The UK plan will result in thousands of people dying who wouldn't have otherwise.Economic gains will be minimal (If not worse) since the economy isn't just the UK. It's pure Insanity. Stumbled in from the front page. I’m not in the medical field, but this feels so important. I have one meager silver shilling, and you’re getting it kind person. Keep spreading that perspective. It’s massively important in the coming days, weeks, months to not stop spreading this information.I am trying to put myself in the shoes of a healthcare worker, and I know this is something I would need to read too. Love you all, thanks for all you do to keep us safe!  We got this. More so - YOU got this. I’ll do my part in staying home and hope I never have to meet any of you! Ha I did read a theory when this was happening in china that the viral load did influence the severity of illness and they thought this is why young HCWs were becoming seriously ill compared to other young healthy people. Dont know if that has been substantiated, but it makes sense to me. I’m off today but I told my coworkers to print that out and post it everywhere this morning. I don’t know if they did. With the obsession with the stock market and his reported attempt to buy the German company working on a vaccine, there is only a thin veil of pretend leadership hiding the profiteer in chief at this point. Because it looks bad and it's an election year. &gt; It's a terrible idea. From what I've read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.The numbers don't really work, though.  There's ~4,000 ICU beds in the UK and the average ventilator time for a Covid-19 patient is around two weeks.  So max they can treat is 8,000 a month or ~80,000 for the remainder of the year.  In a scenario where half the population is infected and 10% need ICU level care that's 3.3 million patients.  So even a perfectly even spread using all available ICU beds, they can treat ~2.4% of the people that need it.  And that's stopping care for everyone else that needs it.  They run around 80% capacity as is, so if we use excess capacity as the number that 2.4% drops to 0.5%.  In a \"everyone gets infected\" scenario we're all pretty fucked and a \"let's get it over with\" plan is probably the best. My spouse is FM (and not on reddit) and is working a COVID tent at a major hospital in a major east coast city. The hospital already has a few dozen covid patients under care.The plan is to use PPE, then come home and  I guess hope for the best. We are both concerned about her contracting and also transmitting to either me or our 6mo son. We have seen anecdotal reports of 10-20% of HCW in Italy contracting, and in this thread about young people (we are both in our 30s) and young doctors essentially dropping dead. Not sure what is real and what isn't.We've tried to figure out a way for her to quarantine but that is impossible physically as she needs to breast feed our son. Looking for data and experiences of others in similar situations, trying to navigate this. I'll briefly summarize [this interview of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/gesundheit/coronavirus/virologe-hendrik-streeck-ueber-corona-neue-symptome-entdeckt-16681450.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2) broadsheet with Hendrik Streek, head of the virological institute at the University of Bonn, Germany, who has conducted field research on ca. 100 outpatient/home quarantine Covid-19 patients in the Heinsberg District cluster. As soon I see a publication in English, I'll post the link.* 30% of the cases had diarrhea, way higher than in previous reports* Virus RNA found in toilet bowls with no prove of being infectious* A German 15-min rapid test was a failure with a sensitivity of 33% and a specifity of 93%.* A new reported symptom? Loss of smell and tasting.&amp;#8203;    \"Nearly all infected we conducted interviews with - and those were two thirds of all - described a loss of smelling and tasting for multiple days. This went so far that a mother could no longer note the smell of a full diapper of her child. Others could no longer smell their shampoo and food started to taste dull. We cannot say right now when those symptoms start to present but we believe it is at some later point during infection.\" No. There have been isolated reports here and there, but nothing very credible. Seeing as you'd need a large population to be re exploded after recovering, and the entire world has less that 7000 recovered people as I write, that's just not possible. This entire tragedy has shined a huge spotlight on America's arrogance. I've heard so many outrageous responses to taking this seriously that I'm already burned out and the worst is still to come.It's like the tide has receded and society is more focused on collecting seashells and IG photos while the tsunami is inevitably about to make landfall.Just this weekend I saw a person, who is a realtor by trade, post that COVID was called an upper respiratory infection in December but the media has now decided to give it a name to incite panic. A realtor posted this theory and it was shared / x-posted and liked by many. https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeonsThis leaves very little wiggle room. Hit me particularly hard I think all you could do is notify Surgical, nursing and hospital leadership regarding the Policy from the American College of Surgeons.https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeonsTheir update leaves little to no wiggle room. What is the rationale for NSAIDs in this disease anyway? Just symptomatic control and anti-pyrexia as usual? I'm not sure how avoiding NSAIDs would necessarily be bad per-se. Lowly M-1 who wants to know more.Given the events and measures taken yesterday, have we done enough?  Were we too late?  How much flattening of the curve did we really achieve with shutting the schools in NYC, banning restaurants, etc?What can the general population expect in the coming week-2 weeks? What possibly could be? It it truly just slowing the spread is all we can hope for? Share the hotlines on those posts. People should be calling ahead to get instructions, and yes, that night take a while, but this isn't a fast killer for anyone getting turned back. It takes getting I'll and deteriorating in week 2 to need hospital management, that's all time to call the hotline. Got a link? I don't see anything on google news about this. Large healthcare organizations aren't doing WFH due to organizational inertia and \"it's not in our values\".  How can we expect other companies to do it? Such amazing adviceX thanks for sharing Is it because it wasn't implemented soon enough? my god in heaven what are they waiting for.......i really cant believe it at this point Not enough data. Same as ACEi/ARB. And to be fair the same as all the proposed antiviral treatments - we just don’t have firm evidence yet. Everyone thinks that they're the \"special case\" and that they deserve different care than what is recommended for everyone else.  Sorry you have to deal with this. extremely irresponsible. my quaternary level facility has suspended all elective cases with only urgent procedures being done. the surgeon general and the american college of surgeons has said the same. although, i think it would depend on if there were any COVID positive cases in your area as well.  the ITaly situation showed they went from 1 positive to overwhelmed in the matter of weeks It's hard as hell, but it is important to remember the first step of every layperson CPR algorithm is to make sure the area is safe for you before going in. In this case, that means you absolutely take the time needed to make sure you don all your PPE properly. Multiplying victims helps no one. If your team becomes infected, what happens to the next patient that needs you? And the one after that? This seems like the course that is described for young people. Recovery followed by death from myocarditis. Wage caps at $2M, 1000% luxury goods tax, 100% inheritance tax above $6M, all essential products under government production/control, public service wage caps at $120k and no holding private investments, term limits of two years, ranked choice tele-voting automatic registration, educators paid more than fund managers, ubi, social security at 55, any for profit organizations profit caps at 25%/yr or 100%taxed. Buy me a hotdog, with, with sauerkraut and onions. The alarming thing is that isolation and shutdown are not thought to be enough to stop this. I am tempted to agree that it's not a good idea, but I'm not sold completely by the total lockdown Singaporean style approach either. It works in the v short-term, medium and long term you have to be skeptical. Just a note to say I don't think the UK government want infection rates to \"maximise\" in any sense, they want to manage the rate in the \"unlikely to need ICU\" population (How possible that is, I have no idea). Concurrently, I think they do plan on implementing an asian country style 'lockdown' but just for \"likely to need ICU\" population.As stated previously, I'm just trying to ascertain the logic here and am not advocating for any particular approach. There are most definitely pros and cons to both. This came up a few times in this megathread over the weekend, but I've yet to see any evidence either way -- i.e. that it does or does not make a difference. One person over the weekend said that there was a message going around about a study from the University of Vienna (I think? somewhere in Vienna) that suggested that all of the sickest Italian patients had been taking NSAIDs. But the institution in Vienna immediately debunked that. The French health minister was saying this about NSAIDs. And supposedly it had to do with ACE. But everything floating around is hearsay. I don't know, I have a lot of people asking me about it and I have absolutely no information either way. jeeze im crying I agree that if this strategy has any hope of working, our \"Likely to need ICU admission patients\" need to isolate ASAP and this needs to be enforceable by law. At least 20 something states have cancelled school. Im sure yours will happen at some point this week. Governors having FOMO left and right (for good reason!) I would say the lack of foresight is frightening but we don’t need foresight...look at China, Iran and Italy. Why do we seem to think we are above it? I’m at a loss. The schedules for the rest of the week are even busier. Yea a family friend is having surgery this week. She's almost 60 and has CKD, DM, HTN, etc.  Like why the fuck is this happening?! I've tried repeatedly to tell her daughter to get her reschedule but she thinks the whole thing isn't a big deal so my concerns are falling on deaf ears. I'm trying to figure out why the hospital is doing it anyways. Here in the midwest we haven't been hit hard yet but it's coming and we're gonna need all the PPE for emergent surgeries, not elective shit now. It feels so to me. My hospital is the same. The schedule today has elective add ons! It amazes me. Our OR is filled with elective cases today. No one seems to care here or elsewhere. Why are we ignoring this? This is the truth: years of training and experience cannot be replaced by books. Please make sure the knowledge is passed on Are you suggesting COVID was the cause of his arrest? Can someone, anyone, answer me WHY domestic flights have not been grounded yet? Yeah that too.  Information is power, the right information can have big results with minimum expenditure. I only address misinformation if it is dangerous/harmful.  Otherwise people can do whatever they want.  That cuts out most of the work right there. It's a terrible idea. From what I've read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.The UK instead is going to maximize the infection rate, overwhelm their health care system quickly, and thereby maximize the amount of casualties. They may shorten the duration of their overall outbreak by a few months, at the price of tens of thousands of lives. Oh that’s terrible. Poor guy. Is this the exact reason patient 31 was such a super spreader? From the salt spraying? It was very brutal. Rip xia And he took out the public health career politician bs and just put a straight doctor in charge of who he listens to. Dr acton My hospital is still allowing a ton of elective surgical cases. Is this as irresponsible as I think it is? I feel like I should refuse to participate in elective cases The NSAID thing is going around Facebook fwiw Do we have a conclusive opinion on the post infection immunity ?And well wishes from Africa. Dismantling the NIH pandemic response office should be criminal with these results. Lives are and will be lost,  not even mentioning economic impacts. Leadership should be held accountable by the people but it seems like we are too far gone for that in this country. I think this is what they are going for as well.I am extremely skeptical for multiple reasons. Firstly, the virus has proven itself extremely contagious. They are not currently doing anything to prevent its spread, and elderly people are not forced into self isolation. So...it's spreading like wildfire right now through every age group. Personally I feel this will overwhelm the NHS within 2-3 weeks.They're also playing a dangerous game with trying to infect the \"healthy\" people as that will still come at a cost - 25 year olds still die of Covid-19. They are less likely to die, but doesn't change the fact that they are certainly sacrificing lives for this \"herd immunity.\"I am also skeptical of herd immunity. Is there any evidence that you even develop immunity to this virus? There have been multiple reports of people who have been positive, then get better and are negative, becoming positive again.  Plus it seems that just like influenza it would be easy for a slightly different strain to come around and make though thousands to hundreds of thousands of people you let die for her immunity utterly pointless.Another interesting thought I saw brought up is that since most other countries are going for the total lockdown eradication route, does this not mean they will have to stop all travel to and from the UK for the foreseeable future? Our current plan is let everyone get infected. If the plan continues for a year, which they think it will, surely that means any country that has stopped the virus via isolation would not allow someone from a country letting it run free come in.Overall, I see why they are trying to mitigate economic effects. I just can't get behind the plan, and I do not see the NHS coping for very long. Well, not all countries have factories making ppe under their command.Now my Utopia on Earth has a strong advanced Heath system and manufacture everything so no imports. Anyone would like to add to my Utopia ? We all need this reminder.  Thank you. Thank you for this. It becomes very concerning when all over the US, we are running out of PPE very quickly. We may get more in the long term but in the short term, the decisions are even more difficult right access to proper PPE. So CDC is recommending no gatherings of 50+ people, yet schools do not count. Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown? Cases are increasing rapidly yet we're pussy footing around and letting people do whatever they want to a large degree. It's so frustrating that we've seen the results of dragging feet from China and Italy and think we will magically not have the same outcomes. &gt; What has happened to America?It was made great.I know we prefer shying away from politics, but this fish rotted from the head from day 1. My wife is going through the same thing.Very disheartening to her when the people who brag about her to their friends, completely ignore the topic they brag about. Guess what news channel is on 24/7?We're going to try one more time tonight. We're hoping we can spin it as we need them to set an example for those around because this is a dangerous situation for my wife. &gt;I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.Wait, what?*Clicks link*...Oh. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infectionThis article states that NSAIDS are supposedly worsening the symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Is there any pathophysiological understanding of why that is? Typically NSAIDS can cause damage to the GI system or renal system, how can it worsen respiratory symptoms? I have been very intrigued by the seemingly slow UK response and the reasons behind it. Having had a think, I think the reason may be about finding a compromise between the health and financial impacts of the pandemic: If non vulnerable people contract the virus (20-50 year olds, no comorbidities) they are unlikely to need ICU admission. Therefore we are not v worried about them getting it. In fact, we want them to get it at a steady rate so we can get them back to being fully fledged members of the economy: working, purchasing etc. They get the virus, they self-isolate for a period and then ideally behave normally. This will be facilitated by widespread rapid home-testing kits, production of which is being accelerated as we speak. Meanwhile we hide away the vulnerable (this group will be defined further in the next few days ie not just over 70s) as they are the ICU admission risk. They are locked away until the Ro drops below one due to the development of \"herd immunity\". I believe the economic risk is the reason for the aversion to a \"lockdown\" type strategy, not negligence.Any thoughts? Agreements/Disagreements?I don't think this is necessarily the correct response but I think its what they are going for. My shop began creating cohort units yesterday. ICU, stepdown, med/surg. Shit's getting real now.Facebook meme status report: less \"it's just flu\" and more \"kids staying at home is the end of my life\". St. Florence Nightingale posting remains hot. Toilet paper memes growing tired and losing value, but still pushed hard by Facebook neophytes. Our government has called for a voluntary ban on gatherings that church services would fit into. However, I think there would be a literal armed revolt if the government tried to actually ban church services. Interesting video about what Nanjing has done to stop the spread:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsdJGj3-jMBiggest things I see are temperature check points everywhere, masks everywhere, and lots of little sensible things like tissue to touch the elevator buttons and not allowing face to face seating at restaurants.  I'm also sure it will warm everyone's heart to see that fast food workers in China have better PPE than medical workers here. So what's the deal with NSAIDs?  Good, Bad, Not enough data? Or spending $0.00 to make an announcement directing people to isolate themselves. # Current Covid-19 stats:  * Total reported cases: 173,833  * Total reported deaths: 6,680 * Total reported recoveries: 77,826 * Estimated death rate: 3.84 u/Number_Bot !Coronavirus Christ, that was brutal. not 2T into masks and ventilators, mind you I honestly don't understand people sometimes.  There is a TON of information out there that unless if you are incredibly sick, don't come in to the ED just to see if you have coronavirus.  Even if you have a known exposure, if your symptoms are mild, you are to call either the state hotline or the hotlines set up by the major health systems near me.  But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.  For one of them, my nurse basically asked them if they thought it was a good idea to come in and expose all of us if they did have it, or if they should just call the hotline like is recommended.  They basically said they didn't know if the hotline open during the middle of the night... hopefully your husband's boss is pressured to implement WFH, and soon This is so infuriating. You are so correct about our need for meaningful code discussions ahead of time. I’ll have to look on SHM if they have recommendations but it may be something for rounders to discuss daily. Thanks for the response. Stay safe! This post is for my healthcare workers, docs, surgeons, Nurses, aids, and ems, but also support staff.There is no emergency in a pandemicYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you're going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You're going to have to put your needs first.I'm speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.If you're an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed)But your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves.You stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.You going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any  patients in the weeks your laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.People are going to die. Do not become one of them. There is no emergency in a pandemic.During the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter, before going in. If we didn't have proper PPE we did NOT go in.There is no emergency in a pandemic.You may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPEThere is no emergency in a pandemic.You may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.There is no emergency in a pandemic.You may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.There is no emergency in a pandemic.A self qaurentined patient has a gun shot wound and is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPEThere is no emergency in a pandemic Many of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn't be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient. Liberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.Then they became infected, they infected others. And they died.  They didn't help anyone after that.Do not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten. I live in Ohio. I’m not a fan of Mike DeWine, but he has been excellent thus far. Leading the way in shutting down sporting events, schools, restaurants, and bars. I expect a complete state shutdown in the next day or two. Everything he has done has been backed by his head of the Ohio Department of Health. The federal government has sucked. Some state governments are doing a good job. When I used to counsel and people would bring these things up, I would encourage them to really do their own in depth research into it... really look into who is \"conducting\" the research and who is \"publishing\" the info- oftentimes it is the company themselves or a company they're paying so there's a financial incentive to make things look good- that line sometimes gets some people thinking. Bringing up the fact that there's no one actually vetting the product and some studies have shown that many supplements dont actually contain the amount they claim on the bottle occasionally helps (not as much as you would think). Explaining that treatment plans are very tailored to the individual and these people dont actually set what's going on with the pt or what they're taking may interact/cause side effects with their meds or disease state may also rope some people.  Things that hit home are when you can relate the situation to something the patient can understand. One of my faves is, \"would you turn to an accountant (or your Aunt Jane) to give you advice on how to fix your car? No, so why take the chance with your body?\" In the case of Dr. Oz, \"how comfortable would you feel asking a heart surgeon to operate on your brain?\" (or something related to the patient's field of work- \"Would you ask the guy who only does oil changes on passenger cars to fix your big rig?\"). Yikes. Only consolidation I can offer is there's about a 98% chance that flight will not be permitted come Saturday. That’s rough.  Code discussions with patients have never been so important.Crash carts around suspected should have PPE in their IMHO.Italy intubates early, as they have seen a fairly predictable pattern of aggressive crumping after a few days of illness You have to allow people a little leeway to engage in bullshit. These are stressful times and people will often double down on vices to manage that stress. If homeopathic bullshit is their jam then they’ll probably look to that. I think the main question is whether the horse shit treatment is harmful or not. For example if someone is taking high levels of an herb/mineral/etc that can cause other health problems to arise, or if they are not taking proper precautions and exposing themselves to risky situations because they think they are immune or whatever. The bottom line is to stress the fact that we know very little about this virus and there is no currently recognized cure(homeopathic or otherwise) and that all of us still need to practice proper sanitation and social distancing. Bars were packed on Saturday night in Boston despite everyone being urged to self-isolate. Now our governor has issued restrictions limiting restaurants and bars to take-out orders only. I fear it's already too late. Gatherings are now limited to 25 people, but my husband still has to go to work in an engineering office with a lot more people than that. Everything is confusion. Have any experts discussed how in the future we can determine how long the social distancing measures and other efforts need to last? Right now we probably can't know how long this needs to go on because we don't know exactly how it's going to spread, but as the weeks and months roll by how can we determine that we have effectively flattened the curve and we can start going back to business as usual?What sort of measures will they be looking at - total number of current and resolved cases? Daisychaining of ventilators in Vegas during the shooting - 8 patients per vent.  It’s been done, but was only for short periods.They were lucky as hell they had a military doc working that night, I can’t imagine what the outcome would have been otherwise.https://epmonthly.com/article/not-heroes-wear-capes-one-las-vegas-ed-saved-hundreds-lives-worst-mass-shooting-u-s-history/ That or the late onset viral myocarditis that’s uncommon but is appArently a thing Nurse who works at a psych crisis center (think psych-only ER) in the US. I’ve barely worked at the place a year but the more senior nurses have quit and I’m known as a smarty-pants who they will look to for guidance.Facility is a 23 hr institution so only day chairs for napping, no beds, communal bathrooms and showers. Barely any PPE. No true isolation rooms whatsoever. Patients are usually two to a room so the best we could do is keep 1 patient to a room at a time... but there’s only 8 rooms. Max capacity is 17 for the entire unit.We get patients who are walk-ins, police drop-offs from the community, and referrals from hospitals. Leadership is struggling to find the right balance of staff safety, patient safety, and infection prevention. Our population and frequent flyers include a lot of older homeless people with chronic coughs. (Fuck.)I have suggested the following:Patients cleared by the hospital must present as afebrile and cough, if present, must be infrequent and the patient needs to be coherent enough to know to cover with his elbow and follow up with hand washing.Patients from the community (including police drop-offs) may enter through the back constables office where we have a separate shower. The patient will be checked for fever and cough; if cleared by nursing, the patient must immediately shower and change into our paper scrubs. Temperatures are checked twice each shift on EVERYONE.The problem we run into is that our population is not always compliant. Already, we had a schizophrenic from home enter in a catatonic state whose arms/legs were rigid and we couldn’t change him into scrubs, let alone shower him. Then he tried to run out the door and needed a B52 so then we got to keep him, yay.Thoughts? Advice? Help. What’s the safest I can keep my psych cuties and my co-workers? LOL What do you mean done nothing? They cut the short interest rate to zero and injected $2T into the markets. /s Seeing posts shared on the lovely Facebook about people trying to get tested in the US and being turned away with a giant hospital bill. I know people here were discussing that this whole thing should increase the population’s trust in the medical system but I’m worried that’s going to completely backfire. Heard about a 35 year old  intensivist dying in Indianapolis yesterday with OOHCA after his shift caring for multiple critically ill patients. Thoughts are with his family and colleagues. I’ve spent way too much of my time over the last several days fighting misinformation among my friends on Facebook (I even reactivated my account to do it). I don’t have a canned response but I’m just trying to calmly point out inaccuracies and include links. I’ve even included some journal links when it seemed appropriate, rather than press or things written for lay readers. IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. But the people who just dabble in whatever they hear about are often happy right now to hear from a doctor who knows what they’re saying. I try to stick only to facts but I do get asked advice and I only give with a lot of caveats and also I keep saying the facts are the best I have but some might be wrong and I’ll update if they are. It’s a complicated line between seeming expert enough for people to take me seriously and making sure I don’t say anything that isn’t true or good advice. I was wondering this as well Question. Attended my first RRT for a patient under precautions with test results pending that night (came back positive today). Severe respiratory distress that happened extremely fast as we waited way too long for PPE. How is everyone stocking crash carts and RSI kits? Our N-95 stock is under lock and key with the house supervisor so no masks were present and PAPR was not on floor. Initially called a code and I cannot imagine if they were truly in cardiac arrest because it took 5+ minutes to get the bare minimum of PPE. It was honestly shocking how fast they went downhill and I never want to be staring at someone threw a window going into that level of distress and anxiety again and not be able to do something because PPE isn’t readily available. I’m trying my best to fight misinformation in my social media circle. Breaking down medical stuff for the layperson in a calm, polite way is my jam. However, when I encounter folks advocating or inquiring about Goop/Dr. Oz “remedies” like essential oils, I struggle.  Obviously, telling these folks that their remedy is horseshit would likely lead to them doubling down on said horseshit.    Does anyone have any good ideas for this situation? Would love to put together a canned response I can tweak as needed. (I know I probably won’t change these people’s minds, but would like a measured response that won’t inflame them, and would leave the door open to further education.) That picture of Magic Kingdom last night is deeply unsettling. The airport photos concerned me but those people were mostly stuck unwittingly. The fact that so many people chose to go to Magic Kingdom, though . . . Is that really from last night? they still basically have not done jack shit up to this point I don’t work in the medical field but my brother is an ER doctor(hasn’t seen any COVID19 cases yet to the best of my knowledge), but these reports of ER doctors falling critically ill has me worried. Is the reason why these doctors fell critically ill just the luck of the draw from contracting the virus itself? Or are medical workers at a higher risk for severe cases because they may be exposed to heavier viral loads if they are around lots of people with the virus all day? I saw someone suggesting the latter on a tv show I watched about the doctor in Wuhan who sounded the alarm and then died(he was only in his 30s). Though I have some suspicions that his real cause of death may be the Chinese communist party. If your country hasn't yet banned gatherings of people in the dozens, especially churches, make sure they do!Here in South Korea we're starting to get over the SCJ cult cluster but now we have multiple small clusters linked to churches. One church sprayed salt water into the mouths of attendees in the belief that it would kill the virus. Of course people coughed onto the nozzle when the salt water hit their tonsils and there are now 40+ cases linked to that church/facepalm This is why the government has to step in and force shit to be shut down. A considerable portion of the population will ignore the warnings and recommendations, and in a situation like this you really need full compliance. I started wondering this last night myself. Came across this [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html?fbclid=IwAR3cjqojQTsW4wPmETYoNkywPuNXSUDNXy5ronkb9nouuV165RNoJbZRhYE) profiling two 29 year old HCWs from China- one doctor and one nurse- and their trajectory after being diagnosed. It's a sobering reminder that although some of us may not fall into higher risk categories,  it's still important to protect ourselves as much as possible in the coming days. I saw a great quote this week that summed up this feeling for me “a week ago, no one had heard of coronavirus or an epidemiologist and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiology.” It’s on both extremes, panickers and deniers couldn’t care that you might actually know something factual as an MD. I need to rant. My wife is being induced tomorrow. Her parents are still planning to go to Cabo on Saturday. I’ve told them virus danger, bringing it to their elderly parents, border lockdown (turning 1 week into 3+) and also how they aren’t to see us for 2 weeks after being on US soil. Totally unfazed. Usual boomer responses- it’s the flu, I feel fine, I’ve lost enough money in the market don’t wanna lose the trip, and the more infuriating ‘you work in a hospital, i think that’s more dangerous’. I’m so beyond pissed. I’m pissed that MDs have lost their authority in this country. Any idiot can put whatever they want on FB, do whatever they want with their bodies and it’s all ok. Question concerning surfactant application:  As far as I know surfactant has proven ineffective in \"usual\" adult septic ARDS due to the complexity of the problem. However I just read that sars-coV-2 attacks the surfactant producing type 2 pneumocytes. Considering the fast pacing collapse of alveolae wouldn't a (possibly repeated) application of surfactant aerosol help keeping them open?   Does anybody know wether this is being reevaluated?

It's obviously not recommended practice and ideally things further upstream would prevent this necessity, but might be worth your time now so that you can muse over it before you're in the situation where you'd even be considering it. The short version is to use CMV pressure cycled mode; tidal volume isn't controllable but peak pressures are. Opiates may help suppress respiratory drive to prevent contagious tachypnoea if you can't set a trigger lockout. There's obviously a lot of deadspace issues and tracking tidal volumes in real time will be difficult.* The UK's RCoA, FICM, ICS, and AAGBI have partnered together to produce a [website full of resources](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/) and guidance. The [clinical guidance section](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/clinical-guidance) is worth bookmarking on your phone; this website is being continuously updated as further evidence and recommendations become available.* There's a nice visual representation of the history of pandemic from the World Economic Forum [here](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/a-visual-history-of-pandemics).* Globally, the number of infections and deaths outside of China has [overtaken](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655bc7db923ab22f97c5afa2c84c33cfdd1437a6/0_26_482_289/master/482.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fa66f7b0028ef967d550645abebd1dad) those inside China [for the first time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-global-deaths-and-infections-overtake-those-inside-china). The CDC has offered expanded guidance for the USA [recommending against gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html) of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks; even the Peace Corps is [withdrawing](https://www.peacecorps.gov/news/library/peace-corps-announces-suspension-volunteer-activities-evacuations-due-covid-19/) its volunteers. I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it's pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though [people](https://www.ft.com/content/4ee1bef8-652b-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5) [still](https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1239403796947755009) [find](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981#block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981) [a way](https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus)...* Staying on the topic of terrible ideas, [new airport screening measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/airports-coronavirus.html) were clearly not properly thought through, cramming thousands of travelers into confined spaces for extended durations:&gt; Wait times as long as seven hours at O’Hare on Saturday night came in the wake of a new policy toward travelers returning from European countries, who went essentially from zero screening on Friday to “enhanced screening.” “I found it a little ironic they had so many people waiting in the same area,” said Genevieve Couldwell, a doctoral student who lives in Salt Lake City and flew from London to New York on Sunday. “We went through this whole process only to be kept in a situation where there might have been more exposure.”* [Leaked documents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised) from Public Health England project a fairly bleak year for us:&gt;The document says that: “As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.”&gt;The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work “in essential services and critical infrastructure” will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”&gt; The document also states that:&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.This isn't necessarily the most likely scenario, but it's rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.* I think it's pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don't want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn't really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I've also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.* Jack Ma, co-founder of China's enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s). Yes, things are bad enough in the USA, that poor, underdeveloped, and disadvantaged country that had absolutely no forewarning about an imminent pandemic /s, that Chinese philanthropists are donating vast quantities of relief supplies. *What has happened to America?** We're hearing [confirmation](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-confirms-that-donald-trump-tried-to-buy-firm-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine/) from Germany that Trump tried to [buy exclusive American](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html) access to a vaccine; things got a bit heated and there seems to be more going on [under the surface](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal):&gt; Last week, the firm mysteriously announced that CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella had been replaced by Ingmar Hoerr, just weeks after Menichella met Trump, his vice-president Mike Pence and representatives of pharma companies in Washington.The German interior crisis committee will be discussing this urgently today and we'll see what they have to say.* Baltimore has a great public health campaign about social distancing [here](https://twitter.com/AlecMacGillis/status/1239360166350532608).

It\\'s been a week since this comment. So much has changed in that week that I want to ask, how are you doing? Are you hanging in there? Now it looks like the US is tanking :/ Doesn’t matter if you burst through the wall like the koolaid man to save a battered wife in a domestic violence incident, if you aren’t paying attention and she stabs you in the neck with a kitchen knife (which actually happens a whole lot. Violent dysfunctional couples are weird...) Absolutely agree on the feelings but that’s totally the point. Best life lesson I’ve learned in my (non medical) career is “if you feel the need to rush, slow down and back up”. It’s what saves you from mistakes, especially when stakes are high. \\n\\nAnd it’s easier when it’s constant, in a weird way. When you have one memorable event a week or day its easy to feel like you have to rush in and fix everything. When it’s a shitstorm when you show up and you know it’ll still be a shitstorm when you leave, you show up, put on your gear, and follow the damn procedures. As an ER medic in an almost no resource environment, thank you. [deleted] Those would definitely be very much needed for these patients. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is the feared complication of COVID-19, and needs specific parameters for ventilation. If you want numbers the protocol is called ARDS-NET. Yes, 100% oxygen would be a huge issue. The hospital oxygen sources I\\'ve seen are all flow restrictive as opposed to pressure regulators, so that wouldn\\'t work for this.  Plus you\\'d be ventilating your patients with 100% oxygen without a compressed air source, risking oxygen toxicity.\\n\\nSorry typo: meant once per 4-6 seconds, not 4-6 times per second.  We had a call with a respiratory therapist yesterday evening who said being able to tweak the rate and limit the compression of the ambubag would be his primary concerns. No, most rooms in a hospital have an oxygen hookup. 4-6 times *a second?!* Where are you reading this?! Also PMing you my work email so I can respond quicker Thanks!    \\n\\n\\nFrom what I\\'ve been able to gather, positive pressure/compressed air/medical air is generally only available in ORs, correct?  \\n\\n\\nAnother idea I\\'ve been looking into is trying to automate an ambu bag/bag valve mask.  I\\'ve got a prototype built where I cannibalized parts from our intermitting suction regulators to be able to drive a piston up and down to compress an ambubag in the 4-6 times per second range the internet says is standard.  What concerns might you have with this concept? ICU RN here, I just want to say thank you for this. I\\'m going to  share this with my co-workers and RN friends. What you said is so significant and profound; I have found some comfort in your words, thank you truly. Powerful reminder If you have questions after reading the link someone else provided, let me know. Would be happy to discuss with you. You could make \\'em last a bit longer by wearing a surgical mask over your N95... if you have them. No nebs.\\n\\nWhat are you guys doing with regards to intubation? Do you have PPE? they started it That\\'s what I was trying to say. Didn\\'t realize this would have started a whole chain of comments/arguments *(I was thinking of the annoucement headline from the Telegraph: \"Boris Johnson shutdowns UK\" - of course, that\\'s not technically correct either)*\\n\\nI\\'ll correct my comment. don\\'t encourage homicide unfortunately good information isn\\'t contagious I’d climb a mountain of bodies to make it to the polls this year, COVID virus or not. &gt;  Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union.\\n\\nThey\\'re bluffing and we need to call their bluff. Things are only going to keep getting worse until ordinary people organise better and yes risk their jobs to stand up for better treatment.\\n\\nAlso please vote... I\\'m not telling you who to vote for, just vote. You misunderstand. He\\'s not *reading* the book, he\\'s trying to *write* the book. I never said the argument for unions was anything but strong; I agree with you about that. My point is that you put your job in serious risk if you attempt to organize your workplace. If you don’t have a 100% perfect record with attendance, zero customer complaints, perfect reviews, etc., then you can 100% count on getting fired or finding your hours cut to 3 a week if you’re part time. And lots of employers aren’t above faking bad reviews or attendance records.  \\n\\nA general strike will only result in millions of terminations. Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union. That\\'s like asking someone how he knows what the weather is without being a meteorologist. Actually, it\\'s worse: it\\'s questioning how someone can know what a book says without being an expert, when all that is required is literacy. Right... so again you\\'re just making the argument for unions stronger.    Since the 1980s when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers there has been a continuous effort to reduce the power of unions and make them irrelevant chipping away at them bit by bit.  We need something like a general strike to get laws on unions changed. See all those people out there in the public with masks? Yuppers. And since we are low on PPE when we are out we go home.... Of course it’s illegal to fire someone for trying to organize. They’ll either find some other way to get rid of you (cutting hours, putting you on the graveyard shift, giving you an impossible workload that will inevitably lead to failure, transfer to their Alaska HQ, etc) or they’ll just fire you as an example to the other workers of what happens when you try to organize.  They’ll consider any fines to be money well spent, if it keeps a union out of their workplace.\\n\\nEdit:  they can and will fire as many people as possible to prevent organization.  If I means shutting down for a week while new workers are hired, so be it.  They’ll do anything and everything necessary to keep a union out, even if it means closing a location. Again this is why we need unions.  If enough people support a union they can\\'t fire everyone.  Anyway depending on which state of the USA it\\'s illegal for them to fire you for discussing a union with your colleagues. You need to be careful, though. In the USA your employer will usually fire you for even contemplating the concept of a union if they find out, if you’re not already covered by one. And if you *do* manage to organize your co-workers, they’ll just shut down your site, like Walmart did/does. ... at which point they will entirely un-ironically shout \"you should\\'ve warned us this would happen!\" Probably also \"you should\\'ve been more prepared!\"\\n\\nWell, you did, and you tried as best as they\\'d let you. I\\'m not sure about full recovery, but at least enough for a hospital to discharge them. Yeah you know this is exactly why unions exist and need to exist.  Support the unions in your industry! The mask is literally my only protection... 30mg is equivalent to about 650mg acetaminophen IIRC. But it\\'s better for pain as far as I know. mdi with spacer is the correct answer. This is horrifying. Thank you for the summary im just basing it off of stories of people being re-infected being very rare, despite the chances of you getting it twice is probably pretty high. If you think about how many tests have been taken, its likely that they weren\\'t all perfect, therefore the people who are allegedly getting it twice are probably just people who had inaccurate tests the first time or something like that. If you could get it again I reckon it would be common knowledge by now idk. Take all the data you see with a pinch of salt, this is the internet Please don\\'t re-write history here. China did not let WHO or other agencies come in until it was MUCH later. They blocked their own scientists and doctors from speaking up early on which led to the spread of this virus. They are not a shining example of anything. In addition, I\\'m not sure anyone believes that their numbers were as low as reported. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if it was actually in the millions. Do you really believe that not a single Chinese military member got infected? \\n\\nThat being said, of course we will study this after the fact and find the best practices from each country. \\n\\nLet\\'s see how how we handle this surge in our ICU\\'s - and what effect the current restrictions have - before we judge ourselves as failures. Or is it anti retro viral use? And if we count in how many people are going to die as a consequence of that economic fallout, how many suicides, broken marriages etc...Both strategies have a bad ending and it is not clear which ending is worse. Hi all,\\n\\nParamedic from Australia here.\\n\\nJust looking for some advice/ideas on the risks involved with prehospital management of infective exacerbation of COPD. A mainstay of our prehospital care of exacerbation of COPD is salbutamol/ipratropium bromide nebs. Obviously this is now a high risk procedure going forward, any recommendations in change of practice? PMDI use with spacers seems to be the logical decision for prehospital management however at this time our service is limited to salbutamol. \\n\\nAny other ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Stay safe out there! &gt; because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.\\n\\nWhy would that be? The clinical significance and direction of the upregulated ACE2 is still ???. There\\'s mouse studies suggesting ACE2 is protective vs acute lung injury. Just want to clarify the 260k deaths is real bad but the real problem is the peak ICU demand 8x of surge capacity The us could accomplish many o the same things but had chosen not to  This will be a crazy case study with chapters upon chapters upon chapters on how we screwed up from not letting the WHO help US, not listening to medical professionals and experts, and just...its frustrating. \\n\\nNot to mention that the people’s mindset in the US vs countries like China are different. The US is more of a .....individualistic look out for myself type mindset?  I’m curious to see where this lockdown will lead Then they’ll just whine about PPE not being available when called on it.  Meanwhile, they don’t give a damn about their workers, and their lawyers can beat up your lawyers. Hi all!\\n\\nThis is somewhat self-promotion, but it\\'s for a good cause and we need medical volunteers so I thought I\\'d post it anyway.  I built a website that allows people who want to volunteer/work to fight coronavirus connect with those that need help, be they hospitals, research labs, or even households. People sign up, and, in a couple of days, those that need volunteers can put in their location and we will provide them with a list of people nearby. Anyone in the US can sign up. If you are interested in helping, please volunteer, upvote or share. \\n\\nWebsite:  [https://endcovid.org/volunteers/](https://endcovid.org/volunteers/) I think we already realize that, while China\\'s response is impressive. \\n\\nWe can\\'t replicate it, China is another beast. \\nMost of the essential resources to implement their plan is already at their disposable or they are able to make them.\\n\\nI think it\\'s ironic that the things that make us describe China as a dystopia. Are things that helped them control the outbreaks. \\n\\nFrom their Extensive Mass Surveillance System, being the factory\\'s of the world, asia\\'s collective culture in general, to the gov complete authority over the people.\\n\\nThey built a hospital in 7 days, were able to manufacture whatever they need from PPE to Ventilators, according to the WHO\\'s mission CT scan is done in 10 mins.\\n\\nCCP realized what needs to be done and had the power and resources to do it.\\n\\nI hate to admit it but we have to acknowledge China\\'s points of strength.\\nAnd I hope that we learn from their strength in the future.\\n\\nHowever, I think that we should look into Singapore and South Korea\\'s Response.\\n\\nBoth are Democracies who are successful in limiting the spread. \\n\\nI also think that it\\'s likely that China will have a second wave but it will be ready for it or maybe be able to prevent it till a vaccine is available. This comment brought the scene in saving Private Ryan to my mind, where they are Omaha and talking about leaving people to move onto someone you can actually save. I\\'m curious about everyone\\'s thoughts on the information surrounding avoiding ibuprofen. I\\'m getting questions from patients and the only reputable mention of it I\\'ve found is in this Lancet article, which only briefly mentions it in the setting of potentially increasing ACE2: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext\\n\\nI\\'m hesitant to base recommendations on laboratory studies but ....? Toradol hasn’t been shown to be a great antipyretic After briefly getting tests back in 3 days, we\\'re back out to 5+ days and we\\'ve been told to cut access to testing to only health care workers and people in the hospital. Sounds like there\\'s a shortage on reagents to me reading between the lines of some things said to me. You\\'re being downvoted, but you are technically correct.\\n\\nThis is the quote from above\\n\\n&gt;  the UK has shutdown yesterday.\\n\\nThe technically correct quote should be\\n\\n&gt; the UK has start to shutdown yesterday Assuming country x somehow prevent infection spread completely. As most ppl stays at home with limited contact to others for more than 14 days ( while 80% of the infected develop Immunity and 20% are treated ).\\nWon\\'t that stop the spread till a case is imported or infection reemerge, repeating the same circle.\\n\\nJust to be clear I\\'m not criticizing any measures taken to minimize the death toll. Hmm, no. Looks like they are afraid it might cause too much fear. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, it shows about 40 or so patients in large rooms with only 1 staff in sight. Patients desaturating, patients semi-unconscious on NRB, patients almost falling out of gourneys. It is one of the saddest things I have seen. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway point was quality of care appears to have really taken a hit with the staffing issues. A year from now, I think we\\'re going to look back at China and realize they were a special case.\\n\\nBecause of China\\'s authoritarian rule, they had the ability (and even the political will-power) to enforce stick lockdowns and ensure this passed relatively quickly.\\n\\nWestern countries will not see the same lockdown response. I\\'d personally expect this to pan out for a lot longer time in western countries. Supposedly they can be reused up to 5 times with the limit being obvious contamination (wet with moisture from ones own breath or body fluid splash), which ever comes first.\\n\\n\\nWith the supply chain issues I guess there is no alternative And special needs students who not only aren\\'t getting school but aren\\'t getting PT, OT, or speech therapist. I have a 3 year old in school who has been doing phenomenally since she started and I\\'m worried that all of her gains will be lost. We can afford to bring people into our house to do it privately for a little while but I\\'m not even sure that\\'s a good idea. Slow down the system. Stop new infections Has there been any case report of COVID-19 in HIV patients ?\\n\\nI think it may Provide insight on the role of immune response and the cytokine storm theory. Let’s put it this way, as a general rule people and animals will develop immunity to a virus after being infected with it. This is how most viruses work, in particular it’s also how most coronaviruses work. There really is no evidence that this virus is an exception to that rule, and if it was then it would make this virus exceptionally unique. A few anecdotal reports that could easily be explained by a flare up or prolonged infection shouldn’t cause us to toss everything we know about viruses out the window. \\n\\nThe bigger concern is that there is some evidence of people being contagious after symptoms have subsided. I am far more worried about people who had the virus spreading it to others after their symptoms are gone than the possibility of this virus being an enigma that causes reinfection. Slow it so the system can handle it. China almost certainly hasn\\'t eliminated it. Word I\\'m not sure if my question make sense, \\n\\nWhen a country shut down, is their goal to slow down the infection to a spread the health system can accommodate. \\n\\nOr are they aiming for China, elimination of the infection till a vaccine is made ? Based on the fact that almost every virus works like that and there really is no evidence that this virus is an exception. Shot by someone who didn\\'t? Good bot Is nonfunctional ppe even considered ppe at that point? Why the devil would you shave... what madness was this? So far the hospital has burned through over 70% of this years entire supply of masks in the last two weeks but we only have one confirmed case and two possibles that are still awaiting testing. My OR has decided to hoard all the N95 masks they could find or acquire, while also punishing people for wearing them while in the OR and attempting to prevent other units from stealing equipment. Anesthesia isn’t very happy with this as they aren’t comfortable working with patients doing even non aerosol generating procedures with the current level of equipment available. It’s business as usual until we get a local outbreak event but there’s a soft limit to adding non-emergent cases. Also several people have come back from cruises and or trips over the weekend but were tested. \\n\\nOne of our people who was working cases was tested on the cruise and shown negative but is back to work with what appears to be “allergies”.  Another who recently returned from Seattle was hanging out in the lounge even though they were off and was also displaying some “allergy” like symptoms. Preop is doing patient screening and visitor limits. Honestly I feel like we’re fucked because nobody is taking any of this seriously, the vast majority of my coworkers have either completely ignored what’s going on as propaganda or just downplayed this as another flu. I get we tend to have blinders on because draining fingers and C-sections are more important but I’m not very confident with how we are approaching things. Considering we live in a fairly large city with a large population of elderly or those considered at risk, when it does kick off we’re going to get slammed. Unfortunately that isn’t an option &gt;  I think you do get immune to it\\n\\nBased on what facts are you saying this? I\\'m not arguing with you, but I\\'m reading so much anecdotal data... That\\'s not really helping. I\\'m not an expert but there are very few reports of reinfection, most of them seem to be anecdotal or a result of inaccurate testing before. I believe in herd immunity. Makes more sense than in China, where they\\'re just gonna get rid of quarantines just for everyone to get re-infected No! The whole point of this post is to *minimize* exposure! In the US &gt; I assume la Repubblica is a reliable news source? \\n\\nYeah, no reason to think this would be faked by the paper/journalist. Hopefully there\\'ll be real analysis on this soon. Thank you. I fully understand all of the above already. I was merely clarifying for the sake of avoiding misinformation that the uk has not shut down yesterday, as stated before. Thank you for all of your information regardless. Like I said, the process has started and is being phased in over the next days/week. So far they have removed emergency personnel from large gatherings, which makes them impossible to insure and therefore impossible to hold. Recommendations on social distancing have been implemented. \\n\\nRight now attending restaurants, clubs, shopping centres is not recommended but not enforced - they want people to comply willingly. But once the UK\\'s caseload reaches the appropriate number, compliance will be enforced. I said the UK hasn’t been shut down yesterday, because it hasn’t. Restaurants, clubs, schools, transport, shopping centres and everything still open. I don’t understand how this constitutes shutting down. Do you know of another source for this video, it\\'s blocked now Yes it has. We were initially following a mitigation strategy, but following a recent report from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College London we\\'ve switched to a suppression strategy (i.e. close it all down). That\\'s not happening instantly, it\\'s being phased in over days. I know that in the hospital I work at (CA) the adult side has run out of swabs and we\\'re dangerously low on reagent. Not that we have any test kits anyways so the swabs were sent to Quest and are just sitting there... If test numbers are being obscured with for that reason, do you think retroactively accurate numbers are likely to emerge once the economy has stabilized?  Or never? No it hasn’t?? first step will be 24h and then continue for a regular shift - so 32h. but i expect to go back to weekend shifts, i.e. 48h, our *regular* workload means i usually get to sleep 4-6h/shift. Yes but I\\'m still unclear, is there an emergency during a pandemic? Can anyone point me to some references regarding immunity after COVID-19? My country has decided to go with the group immunity strategy and frankly I feel a bit anxious; I was under the impression it is not clear at all how immunity works with this virus? The UK has walked back the \"herd immunity\" thing - claiming it was misinterpreted by the media. In any case, the UK has shutdown yesterday. I want so much to direct some nursing colleagues here. I’m afraid, based on their social media, that they would “brigade.” I cause enough trouble without calling in the “it’s just a flu” nurses. Stand by it! My stupid ass sister has  been partying it up in NOLA. I won’t see her until his is ALL over. She can’t be trusted. Period. Symptoms of viral infections(not all) are due to body\\'s immunological response.\\n\\n Glucocorticoids are used in treatment of symptoms of viral infections, f.ex. hemorrhaging fevers.\\n \\nChildren have a weaker immune system then adults and they not affected.\\n\\nSo in theory to temporarily moderate immunological response in severely affected patients could mild but prolong the symptoms. Any professionals have an analysis about what is going on in Japan? It seems like we are running the same “herd immunity” strategy as the UK. I know this may be their strategy to flatten the curve in hopes the Olympics start on schedule but it’s causing people to get restless and ready to get back to normal since the daily numbers are so low. Testing though is low it seems. If I ever build a house I’ll have an attached garage with a laundry room with a shower stall between the house and garage. Or a shower in the garage. Watch these become HGTV features. They’ll call them “Physician Passthroughs” or something. This is not a bad idea. Broken hips and hot spots out to sea. \\n\\nPlus, aren’t there supplies in these ships that could be used? Surely they’re not using “just in time” inventorying. Drop Kick Murphy is live streaming their audience free St Pats show. Please encourage everyone to stay home and watch that ALONE. \\n\\nYour coworkers should be ashamed. And publicly shamed. Ive seen too many nurses saying really stupid shit! Including four nurses and a nursing student that stayed in NOLA until the cops came around to close up shop! It’s gonna be real bad real soon. Also important to note, as the UK report states, China\\'s draconian measures only work so long as they are enforced. As soon as the restrictions are lifted, the virus will resume it\\'s growth.\\n\\nWuhan will have slightly lower transmission rates since some now have immunity, but I believe the number of recovered cases is still very low relative to the city\\'s population, so it likely won\\'t have much of an effect. There are laws to report whistleblowers. I am not familiar enough to say if they protect you for going to the media or just to a regulatory body. I am not currently working and would be happy to research that for you tomorrow if you drop me a PM with your state. That policy is bullshit, unfortunately Are you a med pro!? Can you get off reddit and contribute to the pandemic plz? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe detachment is unreal. There are already 2 US ER docs in critical care. Well get updated numbers tomorrow. That’s been the pattern in IL as far as I can tell. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent\\n\\n&gt; The department of health said there was currently significant pressure on stocks of all consumables used by laboratories.\\nBut it voiced particular concern about RNA extraction.\\n“Due to global demand exceeding supply, stocks of all laboratory related testing consumables are under considerable strain,” a spokeswoman said.\\n“At the moment there are particular concerns around supplies of swabs and DNA extraction kits.”\\n\\nhttps://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-chief-warns-of-supply-pressure-on-reagents-for-coronavirus-tests/573999/\\n\\n&gt; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Wednesday told a House appropriations subcommittee that the agency is “aware of pressure in the supply system on the reagents” needed to run diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus. Specifically, Hahn said “there are pressures particularly around RNA” required for COVID-19 testing. Got me ;-) No parties around anymore due to friggin corona... so I gotta tell Reddit ;-) Stay safe! Removed due to Rule 4 After you had exposure to COVID19 without PPE. Also called quarantine. So... Dont\\' drive faster than Mach 1? ;) Pretty sure if the mask is not your primary protection, you can use anything that is porous to air as a facemask even a tissue paper.  Just be sure to secure tightly so you don\\'t touch your face while in use.  And then follow proper procedure for sanitizing your hands before taking off and disposal. Keep turning those knobs buddy /salute We can only test: people who have been overseas in the last 14 days and have cough or fever; healthcare workers with fever; severe bilateral pneumonia. We are massively under testing. Neither of the two positive cases in my city met testing criteria and both have no idea where they got it. This comment simply doesn’t apply to the situation we’re heading into The stock market is tanking anyways.  It knows whats up.  The US incompetent lack of testing means tracing is a completely useless strategy to mitigate now.  We must assume everyone has it and the sombering study from the UK says that even with maximum measures, the need for ICU\\'s will far exceed our surge capacity by several factors.\\n\\nHere\\'s hoping that chloroquine or one of the other promising drugs is available en mass to mitigate the effects especially the lung fibrosis that\\'s requiring so many infected to be hospitalized. gf-gsw Something you can write on, thought to have originated from Egyptian papyrus I think there are many reagent manufacturers over Europe. I don\\'t know what I would do but by clearing of based on symptoms/clinical examination one does create spreaders sooner or later. Priority 4, give them morph,  get them into the shade and have their mate hold their hand and talk with them. Once you stabilise Pri 3\\'s, go back and check your 4 to try to evac them. The mind is often our worst enemy. This is simplified as best I could. If you’re immunocompromised, your immune system has been suppressed or weakened whether through other preexisting conditions or through drugs like chemotherapy meds. Your body’s white blood cell count ends up lower than normal and you end up being vulnerable to more things whereas a healthy immune system could fight off the majority of things and limit the impact on your body. When you get sick, your body would send WBCs to fight the virus but with a low WBC count and weak immune system, your body cannot effectively fight off the virus, leading to a “worse course” as it infects more cells. It just means they’re at risk for worse outcomes with more moderate/severe symptoms compared to someone who has a healthy immune system. I hope this answers your question! Chicago according to their comment history. LEEEROYYYYYY  \\n  \\nJENKINNNNNNNS To everyone working in a medical laboratory: is your lab or country having problems with obtaining reagents for DNA extraction? We (South Korea) recently had to beg Roche to please send more reagents because the PCR testing volume went through the ceiling. I understand this 100% but this is a nationwide problem and completely out of my hands. We are an island. Apparently the test reagent is made in Italy? They’re keeping it for themselves so we’ve been told. Could mushrooms contain the cure to this virus?\\n\\n\"Antiviral compounds isolated from the mushrooms have shown potential activity against prominent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, etc.\" ? C [removed] Agreed. \\n\\nI had ERT (emergency response team) training before, and we learned triage for mass casualty situations. It was a tough lesson, but our goal is to maximize how many people come out of it alive. If someone is near death, you actually declare that person deceased. You do not spend time trying to save that person until after the triage is done. \\n\\nNormally, for non-disaster situations, the goal is to save that one person, buying time for the paramedics to arrive [this video](https://www.cottagehealth.org/covid-19-video/)  has some good info. I believe later on in this presentation it shows the accuracy.  Having a broch is the most accurate followed by sputum..... My city is likely about to get hit hard. I\\'m a little scared, but I\\'m ready as I\\'ll ever be.\\n\\nIf I die I\\'m going to haunt all of the CMOs. Engineers and fire signs (Sagittarians, Leos, Aries). I know this comes not really helpful from an academic tertiary center, but fight for tests at every cost. Clincal presentation and symptoms are neither specific nor sensitive. We\\'ve seen positives in asymptomatic contact persons or just a mere sore throat. Majority of inital presentations afebrile. Data is powered by PowerBI, here a link: http://aka.ms/covidreport\\n\\nI don\\'t have ICU numbers for US, [here](https://i.imgur.com/KVoY56R.png) is what I have You\\'re not wrong, and I guess I should\\'ve stated that the patient in my example was just contact precaution, not droplet, airborne, or contact + droplet. If they had coronavirus it would be very different. \\n\\nIt\\'s a matter of understanding how the disease that requires them to be isolated is transmitted when making these decisions. The point is that even that event was an emergency if there wasn’t a risk of infection and you weren’t being hit with a pandemic.   In the middle of everything, that is kind of a selfish thing to do...sure you get to feel like you saved that patient (because you obviously did) but at the expense of many others and the safety of yourself and coworkers. RN here. Don’t go back early. Rest. Heal. And love on your new baby. My daughter is 7 months old. I am not doing anything to risk her health. I am not doing anything to risk my health and leave her without a mom. \\n\\nIf you get sick you think the hospital will care about you? You think they’ll remember you in a few months? Screw all that. \\n\\nI’ll do my job. If the hospital does not have enough PPE I’m not going in the patients room. I am not risking my life for anyones except my child’s. Is it after they seem to fully revover in some cases?

As a universal healer in any game I play, I want to just say its people like you who give me that glimmer of decency and help me continue to play. Thank you friend. Am I dumb or why do people keep saying immunosuppression is a risk for worse course? Does tylenol not have same upregulation of receptor? [removed] As a paramedic, thank you. This is what first contact emergency health workers need to learn to do. Slow down, don, proper PPE prior today Pt contact. Also Doff PPE correctly as well. This post might literally be a lifesaver. Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene  than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China.Due to the shortage of masks for which should be better used for doctors ?Or because the masks helps little to prevent for the virus yet hands hygiene helps a lot? \\nThis question confuses me a lot as I saw few people wearing masks in videos or pictures.\\nI would appreciate so much if anyone could tell me where I can find the answer. Really? I thought they lowered the standards because of low supply when in fact N95 is preferred/recommended. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-15/amid-protective-gear-shortages-healthcare-workers-risk-becoming-part-of-the-problem Maybe reach out to the Department of Health (state or federal) and see if they have needs. Go ahead and collect the recovered case counts from the various public health websites yourself and show me that it’s 7,000. Until then, I’ll go with the agglomeration websites, which by and large have been remarkably consistent. Yeah but they mostly say severe ones like cancer/transplants/heart disease/diabetes etc. I couldn’t see any specifics for autoimmune conditions. It\\'s obscene that people are being expected to deduct isolation time from paid time off. Especially medical professionals. Incredibly disgusting.\\n\\nNot that it\\'s a new problem or anything. But you\\'d think that now of all times... So, an agglomeration site, not a public health organisation of any sort. Yeah, no.

The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence **Sergio Romagnani** writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of [Vo \\'Euganeo](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/24/news/coronavirus_vo_euganeo_no_allo_stop_c_e_da_lavorare_la_lite_nella_chat_del_paese-249409885/) where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo \\'Euganeo highlight two very important information: \"the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease \".  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;For Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is \"trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. \" And again: \"It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo \\'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated \".  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;In Vo \\'- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.\\n\\nI assume [la Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/) is a reliable news source? (I\\'ve heard it\\'s as reputable as NYT/Wa Po/etc. Can anyone confirm?) My kids will be fine. I\\'m worried about young children particularly from low socioeconomic areas who don\\'t have access to internet learning, may already be behind in reading or math, and don\\'t have mothers posting their color-coded daily homeschooling schedules and monthly Lego activity calendars on Facebook. Vulnerable populations of children will fall further behind by missing the entire rest of the school year. What about the kids with special needs? The autistic kids who benefit from therapeutic school environments?

Is this the temporary firebreak type vaccine? Worrying about what to do about work, I have autoimmune issues and immune health conditions plus allergies and weak immune system on corticosteroids. \\n\\nI will receive full pay to self isolate but I just can’t fathom doing so or that my bosses will be at all happy about this.\\n\\nJust because they aren’t extremely serious health conditions I feel like I’m in a grey area. I can’t really find much info about autoimmune conditions and covid, can anyone point me to some info? It’s the third rule from House of God - in a cardiac code, the first procedure is to take your own pulse. That doesn\\'t track with any reputable reports ice seen so far. Can you provide a source? \\n\\nAccording to today\\'s WHO situation report, there\\'s a total of 167511 total confirmed cases world wide. Your number would mean that half of all the people that have been confirmed infected have recovered, which simply isn\\'t plausible given the recent hikes in numbers. In most places, tests are only being reported positive/added into the totals once confirmed. I.e. my institution had 2 confirmed inpatient, 8 at home, plus another 50 or so PUIs. State only reports a hundred total cases or so. But there are obviously way more than just my hospital in the state Who issued the restriction? If it came through the executive branch of government, then the police non emergency line. If it came from public health authorities, they should have a telephone number, and will probably take interest in physicians who are ignoring notices. A few months of missed school is mostly just fine. It could be a hassle for kids going into their last year of school and exams, but we can do things like delay exams. Even defer a school year entirely. These are social constructs not fixed in stone.\\n\\nParent sanity is another thing entirely... but I guess I have to cope. \\n\\nNo nation\\'s economy will bounce back from a wave of mass deaths and panic either. Leaders cannot ignore this and hope it will go away. I wish they\\'d see that \"the economy\" exists as part of and for society, it is not an isolated virtual entity that can be considered in isolation from workers/consumers/producers/infrastructure/transport mechanisms as human beings. Better to have a longer period of measured disruption with lots of compensatory and supportive measures like government funded sick leave minimums, limited access small class childcare for critical workers, even temporarily introduce basic income. But no.\\n\\nSocial and mental health impacts concern me too. I\\'ve been home with a 6yo and 3yo almost all the time since Friday. 6yo has a cough, probably nothing but better be cautious and protect others. Plus it\\'s our small way to slow the spread and buy time. But OMG it\\'s frustrating. We\\'ll need to start getting out more once eldest is better, doing limited and cautious social contact a bit. Balance risk with sanity and kids mental health too. (layperson peeking out from lurking, hope it\\'s ok deep in the child comments).\\n\\nCPAP was invented for hospital respiratory support before its later deployment in home sleep aponea treatment, right? My son was on CPAP+O2 for a couple of days after a difficult birth.\\n\\nI know CPAP is not a substitute for a proper ventilator. Even bilevel CPAP doesn\\'t deliver negative pressure for forced exhalation, and it\\'s an open system so there\\'s all the risk of spraying potentially infectious droplets everywhere.\\n\\nBut I\\'m curious about the extent to which consumer CPAP could be hacked to help, possibly in combination with mechanical exhalation support (bands, etc), outflow filtering, etc. Even basic devices have exhalation pressure relief now and bilevel is much more common.\\n\\nI found the recently posted article on the Las Vegas shootings fascinating (and very sad) too, especially using one ventilator for multiple patients by multiplying volume and using Y tubing. Crazy but awesome.\\n\\nI have two MD friends (both ex-ER, one ex-general-surgeon, both now GPs) who have been expressing frustration at the lack of visibility of any efforts being made to plan for these sorts of \"better than nothing\" emergency measures. They don\\'t Reddit so I figured I would ask. I strongly advocate for all facial hair. Anyone who worked with that nurse needs to be quarantined.  Else congratulations on starting a new cluster. I think you\\'re right.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, politicians have friends with money in the markets. Their sentiment towards everyone else?\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roNlgIY9QKw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roNlgIY9QKw) This is really wonderful, good 4 you. I’m just replying so I can copy paste and share this. I also work in healthcare. It’s important everyone stay safe. Our staff is invaluable. Saw a comment here from a PA about a nurse hoarding N95 to swab a patient. PA wanted an n95, nurse shrugged them off. PA got pissed, went to find charge nurse and nurse suddenly \\'\\'found\\'\\' the box in the drawer. I think the bigger issue there was the hoarding, but the provider wanted an n95 for swabbing.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCurrently a new thread about patient treatment prior to result of swab. Nurse describes Droplet PPE (not including hair/eye pro)[https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjv7le/the\\\\_magic\\\\_swab\\\\_test/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fjv7le/the_magic_swab_test/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I’m worried that it’s reducing effectiveness of social distancing. People see only 20 or so cases in our decently sized city and think nbd, but I can’t imagine we have fewer than hundreds to thousands of cases at this point. Is there any significant differences between N95 for HCW and N95 for other work? still always good to bring it up again as new information has been cropping up daily.\\n\\nthat being said, it’s being used but still experimental and i am eager for more information as well. \"Hey everybody, I\\'m a Redditor who has no experience at all with medical care, but I think I know more than a professional so I will try and shit on them for karma.\"\\n\\n\\nin before the edit:\\n\\n\"edit:   Guys, why the downvotes?  I\\'m just trying to save lives?\" My trust is telling us that even if correct PPE hasn’t been worn to not self-isolate unless we get symptoms. We’re currently looking after confirmed COVID-19 patient along with others. But it will upset stockholders! pictures of similar types of examples for those rusty on their oropharynx physical exam would be useful. With what do you decon yours, please? That\\'s a legitimate fear, but more people are going to die if you do nothing. You can always ask the newspaper to remain anonymous. Please call and tell the newspaper what\\'s happening. Lives are at stake. Sounds risky and should only be a last resort if PPE runs out. Not familiar with that product.  Are you saying it will filter a virus? &gt; Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now.\\n\\nThere have been radiologists that work remotely and have hospitals outsource to them for years. Can anyone who’s been seeing cases of COVID-19 give a more detailed description of signs and symptoms?  Specifically I’m interested in the appearance of the oropharynx. Is it very erythematous? Papular erythema? Tonsillitis? Petechiae? I’m a GP working in Australia where we’re rapidly running out of test kits and we’re very restricted on who we can test. When there was an Ebola outbreak and the volunteer doctors sometimes got infected I thought, \"How does Ebola get through their hazmat suits?\"  Then I learned that the dangerous time was when doctors took that stuff off after a long shift - they\\'ve been working long hours in the African heat, they\\'re thirsty, they need the toilet, their faces are dripping sweat and they can\\'t wipe them... If the outside of the Hazmat suit wasn\\'t properly disinfected with a spray, the doctor could easily come into contact with all the infectious fluids on the outside of the suit which had come from their patients (and as Ebola causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding, there could be a lot of these). \\n\\nNot making sure the outside of the suits was thoroughly disinfected was a matter of life and death for these doctors. I have profound admiration for all of the healthcare workers who volunteered their services to work in such unpleasant and distressing circumstances, to try to stop it spreading any further. Don\\'t understand why people are saying a year+ disruption to life.\\n\\nChina got their outbreak under control almost completely in a month and a half. They now have a manageable influx of cases that can likely be controlled with good surveillance and precaution among healthcare professionals. Life will largely be able to go back to normal in Wuhan soon.\\n\\nThere\\'s a false dichotomy here. People will not be able to go back to life where we weren\\'t taking basic COVID precautions like staying home if you were sick, washing your hands, etc., until a vaccine is available, but social distancing CAN more or less end if we commit HARD, right now, before the spread is overwhelming. Dithering at this moment commits us to \"let\\'s get it over with\" and hundreds of thousands - millions of dead. Yet our hospital just changed their quarantine policy to only quarantine if you are symptomatic and no longer quarantine for suspected exposure. What a bunch of clowns. This is my understanding.  What were the qualms expressed in the comments? I think virus negative on PCR I love you. Thank you for your sanity, patience, and effort. It’s very helpful. I’m an old retired person who used to have a medical license, but I am the resource person for maybe 100 real (not virtual) people. \\n\\nWould you post your link to animal rescue again? People can be asymptomatic and be shedding large amounts of the virus. All patients with suspected contact with the virus should be tested and self isolated as per the WHO since current screening is ineffective. However, with the testing issues in the US, this may not be feasible. Ugh. Rest in peace, doctor Xia. Probably change in case counts over a few days. When the increase in cases starts to go down, it\\'s getting under control. Nurse here:\\n\\nWhat are the recommended precautions for these patients?\\n\\nI was under the impression it\\'s droplet + eye/hair protection. Airborne precautions in case of aerosolizing procedures (intubation, bronchoscopy). It is also my understanding that after the procedure they are back to droplet.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIs this true?\\n\\nIve seen two posts/comments with complaints about PPE even though the PPE listed seemed appropriate I’m still trying to figure out how the self quarantined person ended up with a gsw. Where are you? My hypothesis is keeping the economy from collapsing.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny worse news and stocks will dive another 10+%. Emotional times in the market. There\\'s about 80,000 recovered individuals right now. If you get sent to isolation today, who will pop that in tomorrow?\\n\\nThat\\'s the point. You being healthy and uninfected will contribute to saving many many more people than you saving 1 infected person today and then being stuck at home for weeks.\\n\\nIt\\'s not business as usual, it\\'s a pandemic. You\\'re going to lose people and it\\'s going to fucking suck. But society can\\'t afford to lose you and your expertise. Who do we report them to? I know for a fact that my hospital had more positive tests today than is being reported in the news for the state. I don\\'t really know what the disconnect is. It is found in feces, respiratory secretions and blood per [this report](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-covid-19-may-spread-several-different-ways). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere\\'s even evidence to suggest a fecal oral transmission. Icu Rn here. I feel absolute gross having to reuse my n95 Thanks This has been covered extensively for weeks, search the subreddit if you want more information.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fbfj0r/covid19_prophylaxis_in_healthcare_workers/ Yeah, especially the Facebook post doesn\\'t sound remotely close to what I\\'d consider mild. Milder than a bad case of the flu, maybe, but that\\'s a maybe. I am debating going against the policy they set via email which is, essentially, “work unless you’re displaying symptoms.” I think any of us who came into contact with this nurse should self isolate but that would be a lot of people so I can see why they don’t want that. I agree. The clinic recently instituted a policy of essentially “work unless you have symptoms of COVID” which, given the literature, doesn’t sit right with me. Yeah, we have plenty of droplet precaution masks and gloves in clinic, but not enough N95s and to be used in highly suspicious cases of covid only. I\\'ve been told we have goggles, just don\\'t know where. Definitely makes me nervous because we\\'ll probably start having Healthcare workers get sick as we get more cases, and that will create a much more difficult situation. Same goes for us in funeral service. Oh my bad. Please report them if you can. Same thing happened to me. Had to fight tooth and nail with my family to get them to stay put. Was successful but saw a lot of friends who I had personally talked to going out to bars. Lost a lot of respect for some folks, don\\'t know if I can ever look at them the same again. Rule 2 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. You’re the exact person this is meant for.....smh Good Evening,\\n\\nI had a thought after watching these two videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7F1cnWup9M&amp;t=2s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE4_LsftNKM&amp;t=4s\\n\\nIt seems like hydroxychloroquine is being used in China, South Korea and now Australia (where they are calling it a cure) to treat COVID-19. As a pretty common drug its widely available, and it seems that it would be good to take as a preventive treatment for COVID-19 for first responders and healthcare workers who might be exposed to a high viral load by the nature of their job, and, if the reports out of China, South Korea and Australia are right, it might mean a much more mild course of illness for first responders and healthcare workers who contract the illness. Its wide availability and low side effects in most people seem like its worth the risk, if it does work as suggested.\\n\\nWhat do you all think? I\\'m in a similar position as an RN with a 5 week old (that was 5 weeks premature and spent 3 weeks in the nicu). If they need me back early I\\'m going to go back most likely. My husband is not happy but we need my income and it\\'s just part of the job. It\\'s not an easy decision with a newborn. If I\\'m dead but I\\'m #1 in dps that\\'s a win in my book. Thread I had with an Infectious Disease doctor on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ffulwq/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_9th_2020/fk12m2l/?context=10000 &gt; Slow is smooth and smooth is ~~quick~~ fast.\\n\\nBut yes, absolutely. One of my favorites. What is PAPR (insert PnR meme)? China put a draconian but highly effective quarantine into place. South Korea managed to surge test people, and quarantine any positives efficiently. Without similar measures, it just won\\'t happen. It\\'s very real. Even 100m sprinters are taught to take their time. Don\\'t rush it. My postop lung transplx patient coughed her T-piece off and desatted to 80% in a few seconds. I ran in and popped it on and it was a full minute before her o2 sats stabilized. \\n\\nYou\\'re totally right, we should be careful what determines an emergency, but in the ICU it is very situational. These patients are on and off all kinds of support, and they lack any reservoir. A single bad event can be critical to their stability in some of these sickest of pts. \\n\\nGenerally speaking, you\\'re right. Most events dont require true urgency. But there are places and times where we need to move. That\\'s what happens when your healthcare system gets overrun. Patients that might make it with intensive care die, because you don\\'t have the intensive care capacity for the number of cases. [removed] Exactly.  The way your outbreak was discovered was mind blowing to me.  A researcher who went against the government to test for covid in her flu study discovers community spread...\\n\\nWTF.  Supposedly, we have such a critical shortage of masks and other protective equipment in CO that they’re going to shut down testing unless they figure out how to get more.  Geniuses. I’m not sure on if they can force her or not. It’s kind of a moot point with my wife. She isn’t going to say no if they ask her to come back early.  She  is close with everyone there and her being gone means everyone else has to work even harder. \\n\\nWe are lucky because we will be able to get help from family and I have a very flexible job. Layperson here.  I have zero connection to healthcare, aside from being a patient more often than I\\'d like.  I\\'ve been reading these threads on r/medicine for the last 3-4 weeks; it\\'s my primary source of information, and I feel like it\\'s helped me stay ahead of this thing and take proper actions for myself.  I try to pass pieces of it along to those I care about. \\n\\nI have a 65y/o mother with diabetes, hypertension, and on long-term immunotherapy for CLL who refuses to stay home.  Given the PPE shortages and inexcusable failures of our government at all levels to establish ANY kind of plan to mitigate disaster, I also come here for sobering reminders in cold clinical language that affirm my outwardly healthy, vibrant, awesome mom is likely going to die a totally preventable death that I could see from a mile away and was entirely powerless to stop. \\n\\nI love you, medical professionals.  I hate you, healthcare system.  I respect you, science. Business people should also then understand that forcing staff to work without PPE exposes them to being sued for negligence and workers compensation claims.  Not to mention whistle blowers going to the media, in the current climate how do you think a hospital forcing people to work without PPE is going to go with the public? I find this so confusing because the virus seems to have tapered off somewhat quickly in China and South Korea. Should I shave my beard? [deleted] The situation in Italy is bad. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCheck out the video. Patients unmonitored. Some gorked needing tubed.

You are contagious prior to symptom onset. Avg symptom onset is 5-7 days from exposure but can be up to 14 days. Not having symptoms is not reliable indicator. Non-urban, Wisconsin (so some people are probably wayyyyy out of the loop here). Treat non-covid pt\\'s on the boat.  Leave hospitals for the infected. I was so heartened by this effort before I read the page and realized they don’t know what a ventilator is. 14 day self quarantine until enough tests become available. Inability to test is absolutely handcuffing care. That is so tough. I couldn’t imagine having to go back to work so soon after having a baby. Especially to a to that kind of work during this time. Assuming she used FMLA, can they force her to go back before 12 weeks? I love these. I feel like I\\'m a time traveler from the future who has discovered your diary. Please keep going! Can someone comment on how accurate our PCRs are? Should I trust a negative? or is each lab a little different? It doesn\\'t matter. The US apparently only had 1% of the N95 masks on-hand required for an event like this. The hoarders are annoying, but they aren\\'t the problem. Poor planning is. No the phrase is in english, not korean, so dedpite bad grammar i kept it I would talk to your supervisor and explain that you have what you think is close exposure and ask what to do. They might want you to get tested? But that would mean you would have to have access to tests and be out until the results come back. Clearly they have WAY more infections that they don\\'t know about.\\n\\nBut the number of deaths and ICU cases for a country that size is terrifying. I would be wearing a properly fitting N95 respirator and gloves at a minimum. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching anything like your phone, keys and wallet.

[deleted] In the POTUS &amp; Co address today, they mentioned they\\'re working in the upcoming bill to allow N95 masks/cartridges to be supplied by companies who supplied N95 masks to industry (I\\'m assuming this is mostly opening up product lines). Their claim is this would open up a significant amount of domestic production capacity for hospital use. \\n\\nI took this being there is a lot of production capacity for OSHA approved N95 masks which aren\\'t certified for health care use. Check this team out! They\\'re looking at 3D printing ventilators. \\n\\n[Project Open Air](https://www.projectopenair.org/) Thank you. I love the way the data is displayed-is there a link to access these graphs daily?\\n\\nAlso, is there a way to view ICU bed usage within the US? That would tell us how close we are to crashing into the iceberg in the States.. Think about the logistics - you\\'d have to cram a bunch of possibly contagious people on a boat to get them to the ship in the first place, then you\\'d be shipping them to a box crammed with people. I\\'ve never served on one, but those boats are probably better suited for disaster relief than contagion. Fair enough, thanks!

It’s the nurse who sits next to me who was coughing last week who tested positive. I last saw her on Wednesday and I haven’t taken a test and dont have symptoms. I actually just spent an entire hour talking to my doc about this situation and he\\'s frustrated because the people in power aren\\'t making smart choices. And again, we\\'re in Seattle, and his network\\'s team isn\\'t making smart choices. No, that patient was from the SCJ cult while the salt spraying church is nominally mainstream. Well mainstream by Korean standards given that they performed faith healing and were doing so on the day of the salt spraying. Nearly 8% mortality?

Seems a little overly antagonistic now given that my main use of reddit is moderating but, well... sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes he eats you.\\n\\nI would jump at temporary housing. I am slightly worried for my own health but would be devastated if I brought something dangerous home to my family. Was it you or the other nurse who tested positive. Hipster vegans Thanks for the update, I’ve been wondering how different Tribes have been preparing for this. I really hope that you’re able to convince tribal leadership, it sounds like everyone is in a really difficult spot. I haven\\'t been on social in several days because I\\'ve spent every waking hour trying to convince my tribal leadership to take this seriously. No one outside of health care is listening to me because they don\\'t want to close the casino. THIS IS NOT GREED- our tribe is not part of IHS and gaming funds our health care (and everything else). The bill before congress only expands Medicaid and IHS funding. We are on our own. \\n\\nI am exhausted and we haven\\'t even been hit yet.  Though, if we were testing I know of several cases that would likely be positive. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. Plungers are like BIPAP. The key is getting a good seal. Oh good, we\\'re running out of surgical masks (and we have 0 confirmed cases, and are doing extraordinarily few tests) so we\\'re expected to reuse those/put them in a bag. I raised the same point as above - any particles on the outside will get on the inside - and was then told it only applies to the nurses (I\\'m a resident). I was like...that\\'s not any better, the same is still true for them, but haven\\'t gotten a response yet. Unfortunately, that\\'s a totally different skill and equipment set than what we\\'re set up for (capital equipment like ventilators, etc) :( Not just economic. Think about all of the children who aren\\'t in school learning. Also the emotional/psychological toll of extreme social distancing. Ours are being canceled starting tomorrow. True, someone recently characterized a mild COVID19 case as \"the worst cold you will ever have in your life and live through it.\"\\n\\nHaving had bacterial pneumonia before and currently working with COVID19 patients, I hope I will be one of those asymptomatic cases, since the bacterial pneumonia experience was already bad enough. Right, that\\'s what I\\'m saying it\\'s not \\'mild symptoms\\' that\\'s pretty severe. It\\'s super shitty. At the end of the day, protect your family. Get your wife to ensure that her employer has facilities for them to wash coming to &amp; from work. \\n\\nYour wife should ALWAYS ensure that she wears her PPE. Also when leaving for the day she should change her clothes and wash thoroughly. Put the clothes into a plastic bag and either leave them sealed outside or wash them immediately upon returning home. \\n\\nDo what you can to protect yourself. And even more importantly, do everyhting in your power to protect the residents of her home. You guys need to practice social isolation more than anyone. If there\\'s a single case in that LTC facility, there\\'s a high likelihood of multiple fatalities. It\\'s an hypothesis at this point AFAICT:\\n\\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext So no ketorolac either in your opinion? The direct care nurse gave me shift report too. She wasn\\'t wearing PPE for duration of care because she had no reason to. Management should have sent her home immediately but we are short staffed already. People arent taking it seriously enough.... Does anyone have any knowledge about ACE2 upregulation with any NSAID\\'s besides ibuprofen? I\\'m specifically looking at ketorolac. It would be nice to have a non-opioid for muscle/joint pain that isn\\'t going to increase susceptibility to infection by COVID (if that in fact happens with ibuprofen at all, which is just a hypothesis for now). I don\\'t have much time to do a deep dive at the moment, so anything would help.\\n\\nThis is referring to the Lancet article linked below:\\n\\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext I’ve been posting all over worried about my fathers PPE but now a nurse that I sit next to had a bad cough last week. She tested positive for the virus over the weekend. They want me to come in anyway since no symptoms but I feel very concerned after seeing reports of transmission pre-symptoms. I do not want to transfer this to my patients who are primarily acute and elderly. Should I stay home? \\n\\nI am thinking primarily of this article that was shared here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1\\n\\nDoes the evidence seem compelling enough to people that I should self isolate or would PPE be enough to abate most concerns of accidentally infecting those I come into contact with?\\n\\nFWIW I’m at an outpatient clinic this week. They showed a study on that at last week\\'s grand rounds.  From SARs-1, but surgical masks were non inferior.  \\n\\nStill, for aerosol inducing procedures (bronch, intubation), I\\'d definitely want an N95 Unfortunately we’re one of the bigger pediatric hospitals in the US. I’m too afraid to lose my job otherwise I would. to be fair, pneumonia does that to you. Even if you dont have ARDS, the weakness will be with you for some time. Slow is smooth and smooth is quick. I figured it would be old news, I just had to check. Are you in a major city? Have you thought about going to local news, as well? If the news reports that local hospitals are not equipped, I (hope) more people will take their quarantines seriously and it might lessen the load 10-12 days from now. Q: How can you tell if there\\'s a jet pilot at a party?\\n\\nA: Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll tell you. Can I rephrase then?\\n\\nAre we close to having an antibody test? Because I’m wondering if, given the very low reinfection rates, once healthcare workers (such as myself) get COVID-19 can we test for/establish immunity? Maybe rent a furnished studio for her? Will be cheaper than a hotel at least What’s the best case scenario? You feel better for a few hours but follow the same general disease trajectory.\\n\\nWhat’s the worst case? You increase viral uptake and have a more severe disease course.\\n\\nI’ll stick with Tylenol, thanks. Plus..... you guys need tanks at the ready... You know just in case. Our hospital systems’ leadership cancelled elective surgeries today (our state coronavirus rate was at 26 at the time of the announcement), which surprised and impressed me. Also. Plowing money into buying ventilators and equipment is not going to magically train the army of specialists required to use them. Hell even the cleaning staff are specially trained in our intensive care ward. We\\'ve been told we may have to improvise masks out of vaccine bags. This situation really has shown up massive shortcomings in both funding and the planning. There\\'s for sure a lot of variables here that are very hard to predict. I hope your government would step in with some kind of social safety net in that case, I doubt that scenario would happen here in Sweden. thats insane man :( Are they considering that if we keep everything shut down like this for more than a month or so, a bunch of lower income service workers are going to be out on the streets, since they won\\'t be able to make rent? Social distancing isn\\'t going to happen in the homeless camps and breadlines that spring up. I do worry that if we do too much social distancing, it\\'s going to bite us in the ass. Hospitals are already reusing disposable N95\\'s...so...reusable is actually a plus here. Just showed up to work today. An elective surgical patient with bilat pnuemonia exposed ~25 healthcare workers and is being tested for it now.  Essentially an entire floor of staff along with Anesthesia and RT. I don\\'t understand why elective surgeries aren\\'t being canceled. Ours is having us wear a surgical mask over the N95 to keep droplets from contaminating the front of the mask, so it can be more safely reused. Luckily we aren\\'t running out of surgical masks yet. I saw posts on one of these mega threads about HCW avoiding exposing their family. The general consensus was HCW should wear scrubs that the hospital launders, or have a designated \"dirty\" room at home. When you get home, you strip in the \"dirty\" room, wash your clothes and take a shower before coming into contact with the rest of the family.\\n\\nIt\\'s not...great. But it\\'s better than nothing? You can also tip it to propublica: https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/we-want-to-talk-to-people-working-or-living-on-the-front-lines-of-coronavirus-help-us-report We were told not to come in.

Our hospital is low on N95\\'s and has no Papr hoods, for those who need them. If you can\\'t get the raw materials needed for those, even simple stuff like surgical masks, gowns, and gloves are in limited supplies. I know it\\'s not necessarily the most exciting engineering challenge, but it\\'s really what\\'s needed. PPE, vents need people to operate them This is what truly sucks for our situation. We have one bathroom and no garage, wife is an NP caring for an entire LTC home of 100+ patients. I can\\'t think of any way to maintain good protection for me and the kids in this situation. We\\'ve been talking about putting her up in a hotel but how the hell can we afford that for months? Your fist job is to fly that damn plane, your second job is to navigate it around safely (cause you can\\'t navigate anywhere if you\\'re a ground dart), your third job is to communicate. No one cares if you managed to follow proper protocols with ATC if your plane dug a hole. Did you see this hackathon for creating an open-source ventilator? Some interesting comments at the bottom too [https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/](https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/) I believe so. I cannot find the article but they believe most providers who get sick do so by infecting themselves accidentally while donning/doffing PPE Wow, what state are you in? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5.pdf Totally agree.  \\n\\nAt the very least, temporary housing for exposed staff should be made available so that healthcare workers have the option to isolate themselves if they feel it necessary.  \\n\\nMaybe the stockpiles don’t exist. That could be.  Then maybe we need to consider dedicating facilities to Covid 19 patients.  \\n\\nRapid 4 hour testing prior to admission would make this possible in large urban communities.\\n\\nThere are so many ways this terrible situation could be addressed without throwing millions of healthcare workers into a gunfight to do battle with butter knives. They are aware. Revenue seems to be more important at this point. It’s sad. &gt;With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.\\n\\nFor what\\'s it\\'s worth, I\\'ve seen some evidence that surgical masks are just about as effective as N95 masks for protection. N95 masks have been recommended because they\\'re known to filter particles as small as SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and preliminary reports of of China indicated that the virus *might* be able to aerosolize and be inhaled without filtration. However, since then, true widespread airborne transmission hasn\\'t really been confirmed, and the consensus now seems to be that it mostly or only travels through respiratory droplets. *Surgical masks protect against droplets just as well as N95s*. It may be more reasonable to use home health services for other non-COVID cases as the respiratory compensation requiring intubation seems to be rather rapid. I agree that it needs to happen now - and that is why I explained how it will happen and when it will happen. The hospitals with higher levels of emergency preparedness are really shining right now and I feel horrible for everyone else. You shouldn\\'t be in this position. Someone shared this with me here yesterday, [head of dept of anesthesia and ICU in a research hospital in Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKS1pahoPRU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=412) talking about his experience right now. They cancelled elective surgeries and had to increase capacity significantly to handle the surge. It sounds like they were extremely well-equipped to handle the situation, and it still continues to be difficult for them every day. Consider sharing it with your superiors or coworkers. I assume Italy\\'s recommendations should not be taken lightly. He is such a fucking bastard. Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. it\\'s respiratory.  PPE more important.  Should wash hands too [BBC also just reported that Alibaba co-founder is shipping supplies to us.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51904379) Unfortunately, much of this is not being reported in local news, maybe to limit panic? ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ It would lose  \\n(⌐■_■) the element of supplies Maybe masks and other PPE? “No you’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”\\n“All right then.”\\n\\nFavorite movie of all time. \\n\\nI empathize with your situation.  \\n\\nWe’re sleeping in separate beds also.  At the very least, if hospitals are not providing proper PPE they should make temporary housing available for staff do they can reduce the chance of transmitting to their community.  This is what happened in China, correct?\\n\\nAt a certain point, it does become a question of ethics, and I can see where you are coming from. \\n\\nAt the same time, critical care RNs exposed to infectious patients for hours on end without proper PPE strikes me as dumb, counterproductive, and ethically wrong.   I’m the asshole in this ethical situation, and I know the subtext is that people don’t get care.  And yet if we look at italy, that’s the exact situation their healthcare providers are in.  \\n\\nSo I don’t know what the answer is, except the situation is incredibly disturbing and I think we need to vocalize it so that the public is aware of what is happening. I totally agree that PPE should be made available to staff. Staff should be protected as well as be able to reduce spread between patients. It seems fucking obvious to me that cost should not be a factor, and if stockpiles exist, they should be distributed as required. My understanding is that, in many cases, there actually aren\\'t stockpiles, and that ordering through the usual pathways is not helpful. What we shouldn\\'t do is just abandon people in their hour of greatest need and close hospitals. Safest bet, if you have a mild to moderate case just take paracetamol(acetaminofen) to control your temperature.

Probably unrelated but reminds me of my work as airline pilot: We never rush, take our time. If not available, we make time. ESPECIALLY when shit hits the fan. My local hardware store still has a few half face respirators and filter kits available - P100.

Lessons from China about proper PPE from Xihong Lin, a professor at the Harvard Department of Biostatistics (see slides 55-56).  The protocol in China is a protective suit, medical goggles, cap, face shield, mask, and gloves when seeing suspected COVID cases.  Using this level of protection, none of the 42,000 external doctors and nurses sent to Wuhan was infected, though some of the internal doctors were, before adequate PPE was used.\\n\\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14tGJF9tdv4osPhY1-fswLcSlWZJ9zx45/edit I remember reading about mRNA vaccines a few years ago in an immunology text book, it was a relatively recent book, but they made it sound like these were a long way away.  I guess this is as good an opportunity as any to give it a try as we are in dire need of a vaccine and not having to wait for incubation would be huge.  Don\\'t believe there are any other mRNA vaccines on the market. I\\'m not sure where you are but it hasn\\'t hit us hard here in Canada yet. My girlfriend is also an ICU nurse.

It took 6h to get it because they have to clean out the CTs after every suspected covid. And my attending made me call and ask to please hurry with it two times (I apologized obv).

Also sketchy reports but in Italy they have supposedly been using echo to decide who to give vents to (avoiding those with newly diminished EF). People are talking about getting back to normal in a few weeks right now on the radio (NPR).\\n\\nI don\\'t know, at some point we are going to have to decide what social distancing to maintain long term and what not to. I don\\'t think we can keep schools closed for 18 months. You are so correct and honestly I’m a dumb ass when it comes to doing anything to help. I blame comics. It was a place I never thought I’d be and feel rattled by it. I absolutely did not risk myself without proper PPE and kicked out those who didn’t. We didn’t even have it on the unit or near this unstable individual. It was also a poor execution of transport. Our policy is to place a blanket of intubated patients and close doors. Our COVID unit is 2 elevators and 3 hallways away from ICU   and probably 1/4 mile total. We are out of PPE in a major midwest urban US hospital. Even surgical masks are under lock and key and are not being distributed outside ER/MICU. Patients still need to be seen in my clinic. We have canceled every appointment we can, and are able to re-route symptomatic patients to a dedicated COVID testing suite so we are lucky in that sense, but I still feel my odds of exposure are 100%. We know the infectious risk peaks right before/at the initiation of symptoms. I don\\'t think I can (or will) ethically refuse to see patients who are very ill and on active treatment. I am thinking of at least starting to sleep on the couch to try to isolate myself from my family. This whole comment chain is a much needed window of fun in a pretty grim time. Thank you. Ive been asked this multiple and gave this exact response, but i started doubting myself after my shift. Dps saying thanks for the heals. Also, human saying thank you for being a real life healer. It requires a cell number confirmation too Imperial College has released their modeling of different mitigation/suppression strategies for this epidemic. Looks like we are in for a very long haul (until we get a working vaccine) unless we accept a high amount of mortality.\\n\\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf Yeah, it\\'s giving me some trouble, it should be up and running soon. Feel free to try and use it but don\\'t necessarily expect a swift answer. make a throwaway email and twitter handle whilst using a VPN. No one will know who you are. &gt; I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required.\\n\\n&gt; healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should.\\n\\nWith as much as we spend on healthcare in the US, how the hell is it this bad?! One million US deaths in the best case scenario which seems to include 18 months of social distancing? \\n\\nCan you imagine what the world would be like a year from now? I can’t comprehend it. Apparently China forced manufacturers of other goods to start manufacturing PPE and hand sanitizer. A friend mind is from China and her extended family offered to send her a bunch of masks and hand sanitizer. We\\'re in Seattle, so she was like, \"Hmmmm...\" She\\'s MS though so she can work from home, so they\\'re all pretty safe and security. You absolutely have to post before/after pics! We need something lighthearted. I don\\'t see this the same as taking 30 seconds to throw on PPE.    \\n    \\nUsing \"due care\" as reasoning to be this reserved does not justify driving in a manner such as this all the time. There needs to be a balance and driving to emergencies is completely fluid based on severity of offense, other motorists, road conditions, etc.   \\n    \\nExperience is the better teacher and if an experienced cop were to always be this reserved, they should additionally be prepared to have their actions highly scrutinized by the public and civilly litigated when it results it people dying.      \\n   \\nI get where you\\'re coming from but when there is an in-progress violent offense, or mass casualty event taking place, some of these recommendations for driving go straight out the window. Except PPE... where that crap. Damn, my asthma means every cold kicks my ass for 9 days. I just read this from NPR about how N95s are difficult to make, the manufacturers are running above 110% capacity and they are repurposing other factories to produce them ...\\n\\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-mak Eh I have asthma and that\\'s pretty much what happens when I get a any old cold. And no paperwork. Nurses are pally tanks, have to tank and heal. surgeons are resto priests Meanwhile, I\\'m not even sure Trump is fluent in English... EUROPE - please, for the love of God, if you are a HCW of any sort and even though Europe is a hotspot for covid-19 and you still decide to go on trips to other countries especially and spend time with your friends, stay home for 14 days as the gov ordered few days ago. [this article ](https://www.cas.sk/clanok/958343/lekar-z-kramarov-ma-koronavirus-sokujuce-slova-kolegovej-manzelky-toto-vas-uplne-odrovna/) (article is in Slovak language) informs about a doctor from a major hospital in the capital city of Slovakia, who took a vacation in Austria, socialized with his friends, came back to Slovakia and did not stay home (mandatory 14 days or you get a fine) and went to work as usual, did surgeries, saw patients, worked in the ED and such and of course then he started coughing a lot and tested positive for covid-19. This resulted in quarantine for additional 27 HCW. So irresponsible. ### Removed under Rule 2:\\n\\nNo personal health situations.

[removed] Seriously, they need to be taking this more seriously and start acting with a sense of urgency. What’s your institutions policy on staff working with URTI or LRTI symptoms? It seems to me that we can’t sustain having everyone off for mostly other viral cases, but that there is a fair bit of cases we will miss and allow to work if we aren’t somewhat strict in HCWs isolating when symptomatic. My wifes hospital is canceling all non emergency surgeries, pretty much just because the lack of PPE I would love to see them get interviewed and try to explain why they chose now of all times to take a completely impromptu road trip. I think in a few weeks Americans will have VERY strong negative feelings towards that kind of completely irresponsible behavior.\\n\\nI literally told my friend, who is objectively brilliant and very well-liked, you could literally be responsible for multiple deaths and never realize it. I have it in writing over text... But that just wasn\\'t a persuasive argument somehow. This past week has honestly changed my opinion on human nature. Personal protective equipment, ie masks, gloves, etc The only issue for the re-usable respirators is that you have to disinfect everything except the filter parts of it before donning/doffing, otherwise you risk infection. They’re unavailable too It’s not about congress moving slow or the president promising to make them available. It hasn’t happened.  End of story.  They need to make it happen NOW otherwise we as healthcare workers are literally enabling the problem to get worse. Is there any _benefit_ to Paracetamol or NSAIDS in COVID.? I have seen several reports of NSAIDs being harmful, and some for paracetamol worsening outcomes in viral infections. \\n\\nGiven this, I’m tempted to say just don’t give any paracetamol or NSAIDS unless temperature rises drastically to harmful levels. Would this lead to any harm? Personal Protective Equipment. Exactly.  I’ve seen reports in local news about staff reusing masks.  The FDA and CDC both support this practice in times of critical shortage.  It’s time we alert people that we’re in that period of crisis. Personal Protective Equipment, things like isolation gowns, gloves, &amp; masks. Personal protective equipment I\\'m trying to predict patient flow for my local area. Does anyone have any timeline-type references/resources that I can compare to my anecdotal impression of the emergency department? I\\'ve listened to many of the podcasts from Italian physicians and I feel like I should be anticipating a surge of pneumonias any minute. \\n\\nWe started seeing quite a few r/o\\'s about a week ago, and have steadily increased this volume so that about 30% of our census have been symptomatic rule outs as of this weekend. That being said, we have not had very many fulminant cases - maybe 5-10 that I am aware of in the last week or so (my last week\\'s shifts have all been ED - surprise surprise).\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t help that our testing remains limited, and with a 3-5 day turnaround still common. My mom is also super religious, lives in south GA. Her church still hasn\\'t canceled services...even though an entire family is in self quarantine due to their (adult) son who lives with them having all the symptoms and is a presumptive case.\\n\\nShe refuses to stop attending. She and my dad are both in the high risk group. I explained that asymptomatic people can spread this, and that all it takes is one person in that group to inadvertently spread it to everyone else. \\n\\nDidn\\'t make a difference. Though I did just see that Trump is saying to avoid groups of more than 10 people, so maybe now she\\'ll listen 🙄 I work in an outpatient clinic as well. No PPE available.  It’s on backorder until the end of April.  \\n\\nDoctors are shutting down the office tomorrow and only doing virtual visits.  I support this 100%.  \\n\\nI’d rather lose my job and my paycheck then lose my life or be the reason why another person loses theirs.  \\n\\nMy husband is going to work in critical care ONLY IF he has access to N95s.  \\n\\nIt’s not hard to see that sick or dead nurses and doctors can’t help anyone.  I don’t understand why individuals voluntarily give up their rights, it only makes the situation worse for everyone. Personal Protective Equipment. Read: Mask/respirator, gloves. Personal Protective Equipment. In this case, referring to masks, face shields, gloves and isolation gowns. Personal Protective Equipment I bought a P100 mask, protects the same as N95 but includes oils, reusable, you can decon it, and currently I haven\\'t seen any shortages of the masks or filter inserts. Also much more comfortable thus more likely to be used.\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24011377/ Removed due to Rule 2 Bro that means \"Dipshit tourist\" What is PPE? Improper PPE = unsafe working conditions = right to protest.  Especially during a pandemic when my lack of PPE means that I could potentially infect dozens of others.  \\n\\nTo be clear, the teachers didn’t actually strike. They just organized to make it happen if absolutely necessary.  In the same way, healthcare workers could organize to demand access to the national stockpiles of PPE NOW.  And not wait until there are 1000s of us sick and dying as patients on the very units were supposed to staff.... No. 1 rule of ems - don\\'t give somebody else TWO people to save I support any nurse in refusing to work unless they are provided proper PPE.  Period.\\n\\nEdit: spelling austria here. we completed the shutdown today, only providing emergency care now, discharged as many patients as possible. working hour restrictions are suspended, we\\'ll go back to 36h+ shifts and we reduced staff at the hospital to about 20% for now, although i don\\'t expect this to last long. we\\'ll start working in small teams (2 -3 people) from tomorrow on to reduce the impact of quarantine measures. while we are supposed to be the last hospital to treat covid cases in the city, the doubling rate is alarmingly high (\\\\~2.3 days) and we expect a surge sometime next week. pretty surreal feeling right now. I thought there were some in Singapore?  ICU nurse here, we have been lotted to one mask per day if patient is regular droplet (flu/mycoplasm,RSV;etc.) When the patient is POI (person of interest - suspected covid19) we treat them as droplet and are able to throw away masks after use. Only until confirmed positive are we allowed to use face shields, BUT with only a droplet mask still.  \\n\\n Our hospital did not prepare and is trying to order masks late in the game. 10 ICU staff have been sent home on quarantine leave primarily nurses and respiratory.  ICU doctor stated he expects to get sick and would rather get it over with and take up a hospital bed now before it gets terrible. \\n\\nWash ur hands muh dudes. Not to mention they may not be able to come back home! Then they\\'ll be interviewed on TV as casualties of the terrible lockdown. Gfy! So what does this mean clinically? Like my new ankle tattoo? It means WISDM in Chinese Do you have a link to the sheet you mentioned? I remembered seeing this mentioned (death after a patient appears to recover) but couldn\\'t remember where and wasn\\'t able to find it. Thanks There has been a lot of coverage of this - it was even asked in the White House press conference today. In the legislation being passed, they are trying to allow N95 masks that were made for construction etc by 3M to be used for medical work. They have a LOT more of these - and are making 30 million a month just at 3M. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Congress moves slowly. But expect this to be passed this week and see some supply improvement through an infusion of these masks. Shouting out my RTs forever they\\'ve saved my ass so many times when my pt is trying to die on me or something. Love when they show up when I\\'m in a crunch. Thanks! Fury warrior... Yeah, that\\'s the US. Oh my goodness. Our respiratory therapists are not forgotten over here. You all roam the halls and have had my patients\\' backs time and time again and I am confident that y\\'all will have my back through this pandemic as well. \\n\\nWe are a team. All of us. And we are strong, capable, and will make it through this thanks to all of our combined expertise and continued willingness to serve. ✊ Proper translations wouldn\\'t look as cool on a license plate and removes the appeal of \"ooh, Asian proverb much wisdom.\" Keep in mind that a lot of healthcare org inertia comes from heavy baggage around things like regulation and billing that are directed rigidly from the top (i.e. government) down or by other outside factors. [Some places are reporting it in bits and pieces but not getting enough traction?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html)\\n\\nEdited to add that there\\'s a quick mention or 2 of respirators in the article but no real mention of the reality some HCWs are facing. This is exactly what I have heard from other providers in outpatient clinics. I don’t do critical care or anything but like... surely at the point that you’re reusing masks and gloves to that extent you might as well not use PPE? I can’t tell if I’m in the minority for finding this disturbing. i have come to realize that the space between my nose and my upper lip looks ridiculous. This goes for your friendly neighborhood clinical engineering techs that receive the call to fix your monitor that\\'s showing a low battery / won\\'t stop beeping / can\\'t get patient information in too. PPE, protect yo\\' neck, 100%. Thanks, that\\'s a great article I will definitely analyze in depth.  My boss had asked about a splitter, so that\\'s something I can definitely forward on. [deleted] Just so I\\'m clear what you\\'re suggesting, you want healthcare workers to strike until hospitals close? During a pandemic? [removed] Minutes to hours, for damage.  But it sounds like you\\'re very in tune with the granular need to control this, and you should reach out to your local hospital or the academic center nearest you to speak to the Pulm/Critical Care docs there. I\\'m a spoiled rotton community EM physician who doesn\\'t have to care for boarded vented ICU patients, so it\\'s been about 5 years since I\\'ve thought very seriously about any of this.  But here\\'s a great well written link to a smart EM/Critical Care blog piece about the implications of messing around with vents which may serve your purposes.   He\\'s coming at it from the idea of splitting a vent between two patients and what that would mean.  (This was actually done on the fly to help trauma patients survive the Las Vegas mass shooting event, which is very different medically as those are young patients not presumed to have lung disease or infectious illness who could be matched up by approx lung volume and had no unusual concerns about lung compliance or oxygenation).   [https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/) Are there any risks of that being hard to come up with or taking more than say a year? I am sure that would be an excellent business now. And really useful for countries to follow up the spread and immunity and establish how well the strategies are working. We\\'re hearing from the Italians that lung compliance tends to be good. Same deal here. Additionally asked not to bring trauma teams into CT area - send 1 person and leave everyone else behind. I agree with you that it\\'s scary and dangerous. The problem is, us not wanting to expose ourselves won\\'t magically make PPE appear. There\\'s a global shortage. This isn\\'t a situation where strike action (formal or informal) means we can influence leaders and effect change to make it safer. Anyone without risk factors refusing to work with the (suboptimal) PPE we have is just increasing the strain on the system. \\n\\nI\\'m not saying any individual has to do it if they don\\'t want to, but don\\'t mistake it for stupidity or a lack of awareness in colleagues who choose to still work as one of the least worst options available. My mother isn\\'t quite Goop level but is attracted to natural remedies like a toddler with bubbles.  I find this article to be very helpful - an MD integrative medicine specialist, but the good kind, and it goes in depth about how we need to first of all make certain that our natural remedies don\\'t interfere with evidence based care, and then appeases her by going into depth about various herbs and stuff.    [https://avivaromm.com/covid-19-natural-prevention/?fbclid=IwAR2VAOyV8sutUhMiekVOpFSkeIIMDrGpw7CX2EDOl2VxKbnMXJ8IpaAUlV4](https://avivaromm.com/covid-19-natural-prevention/?fbclid=IwAR2VAOyV8sutUhMiekVOpFSkeIIMDrGpw7CX2EDOl2VxKbnMXJ8IpaAUlV4) Let us know what conditions are like. Teachers planned a sick out in NYC and suddenly the schools closed, RNs need to follow. Why are all proverbs translated without grammar? \"Saving a doctor saves lives.\" Gonna find out tonight. I almost got into an argument with a friend who told me she got a hold of 100 masks and that it wasn\\'t her fault that others weren\\'t prepared for this while she was amassing 4-6 weeks of food for herself and her son. I told her if anything please donate the extra masks. Meanwhile, yeah, this. Reusing masks and gowns and everything, that\\'s so unsafe for the staff. Ughhhh I\\'m always jealous of the US. I wish we had respiratory therapists here, I don\\'t think people here recognise how important good vent settings are to a patients outcome I\\'m expected to manage medications, cares and the ventilator in Australia. It\\'s sad but they won\\'t listen because that hot topic they\\'re spewing hot garbage about is what keeps the listener captivated. It\\'d be nice to silence the uninformed but alas, the means are not there at this time. [deleted] RN here. PPE shortages are REAL.  Why isn’t the media all over this?  Yes there aren’t enough ventilators...but my local hospital sent out an email informing all clinical staff that they are to wear THE SAME SURGICAL MASK for days or weeks until it is visibly soiled or broken...N95s under lock and key.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the conditions like in your hospital/facility? What about reusing surgical masks and gloves between patients for an entire day? As in, taking them on and off? I\\'m curious about the myocarditis secondary to COVID-19. What is its onset relative to time of exposure/onset of symptoms? Have there been any predictors for who has gotten it? Any effective treatments? Yeah. I\\'ve submitted it as a text post to the subreddit, hopefully more people can see it that way.\\n\\nThe full report is really something. Excellent, thank you. Key points from the summary:\\n\\n&gt; We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. \\n\\nMitigation works, but not well enough.\\n\\n&gt;Suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \\\\[...\\\\] will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. \\n\\nSuppression is of course optimal from a purely epidemiological perspective, but can we bear the costs of shutting down huge parts of our economy for an extended period of time?\\n\\nLooking forward to reading the full report when I have time, great find. &gt; (emphasis mine) I\\'ve had a **chest pressure almost like you feel like you\\'ve done a big chest workout**. I\\'ve had a little bit of a cough. I had a relatively mild fever. I\\'ve had kind of weird aches and pains in places I\\'m not used to. But honestly, I feel like I\\'ve had colds and flus worse than this. **I\\'ve never been totally out for the whole day in bed.** I\\'ve been up, able to talk with people. So for me, luckily, it\\'s been quite mild.\\n\\nConsidering it\\'s not ARDS, yes it might be mild COVID19 but that sounds pretty severe in my professional opinion, lol I\\'m not doing telehealth, but my understanding was that for medicare you use E&amp;M codes + a telehealth modifier, though im not sure the modifier, 95, GT, or something else. I caught that. I meant \"keep going\" with the other spelling mishaps, but it\\'s not your job. \\nMe? I work in the \"a/an\" pet-peeve department. i know..........dont do it Right?? I dont understand the logic of these patients. Also frustrated at my residency program for not taking it more seriously and only allowing urgent appointments at our clinic. Infuriating. There’s no discharge in the war Yes! I want to tweet it. There’s such a huge medical presence in Twitter. Just not sure how easy it is to track and fire me. &gt; _sighs_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should.\\n\\nFuck Trump and his shithole administrration. (from an american) YES. As Koreans been saying, SAVE DR SAVE LIFE. Applies to other health prof ofc. isnt it enraging? It sounds like there are pretty considerable reasons why the rads residents can\\'t work from home. I dunno, I feel more concern for the EM/gas/ICU fellows who have to be exposed to aerosolized secretions to be honest. Here\\'s the data underlying the UK government\\'s response - and they\\'ve modelled the US as well. This is the report that has resulted in the UK\\'s latest social distancing measures.\\n\\nHighlights include: deaths in the US of approximately 1 million people. Peak demand more than 8x greater ICU surge capacity in both the US and UK. Any social distancing measures must be in place until a vaccine is disseminated.\\n\\nReport 9\\n\\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/ I think our best guess at this comes from comparing the curves of the pace at which new cases were identified.  I found one graph that implies we have tried to establish quarantine a few days ahead of where Italy was, which sounds hopeful.  On the other hand, they have more hospital beds per capita than we do, which is depressing.  \"your laying in a hospital bed\"\\n\\n Just correcting my pet peeve ;) Keep going... Very well worded comment. It might just save lives. All of the coronavirus-related articles on NY times site are free but you\\'ll have to create an account. Hope this helps. Looking at this article, the design I\\'m envisioning would follow the \"biphasic ventilation\" model seen about 2/3 the way down this link.  It\\'d be a disposable connection set that would take advantage of an existing intermitting suction regulator and a positive pressure source to create the alternation needed for breathing. Both pressures would be fully adjustable by clinicians.  So while there\\'d be no automation available, it might be manageable if there were enough hands but not enough ventilators.\\nhttps://emedicine.medscape.com/article/304068-overview#a7\\n\\nWhat timescale does the harm you\\'re referring to occur across? It could sort of fit under the code blue admonishment of checking your own pulse first. I agree it would’ve explicitly been in there if it were more timely. EXACTLY. If we can give front line workers extra time to fix the shortages of PPE and critical care equipment, we\\'re helping them (which means saving not only their lives, but their patients as well) Have there been any studies/surveys showing that HCWs actually are getting higher rates of severe disease? I agree. As a radiology resident, I\\'m OK with my attendings--many of whom are much older than me--staying home and working from there rather than risk getting infected. We might need some attendings for any urgent procedures, but otherwise, us seniors can handle a lot on our own.\\n\\nAnd like Boomboomgel said, home reading stations are expensive. You should not use just any old computer monitor, for example, as they may not provide the adequate luminance and resolution for optimal diagnostic decisions. Further details are available in the ACR-AAPM-SIIM Technical Standard for Electronic Practice of Medical Imaging. Good advice. Thank you. It\\'s probably important to remember scale. 0.2% is still 60,000 20-35 year olds dead at 50% saturation. That doesn\\'t even account for hospitalizations or long term lung damage. That’s fair. Good points. I’ve got no problem with someone putting an amethyst in their shoe or whatever, as long as that person is taking other precautions. Unfortunately, this kind of balanced, dual approach does not appear to be the norm. Paywall for me? New meta-analysis of of Covid-19 out on preprint. Key findings: dyspnoea key predictive symptom for ICU admission and severe disease; COPD, cardiovascular disease and hypertension also predictive.\\n\\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1 Any links or texts that explain the minutiae of it I could look into? No antibody tests currently but I’m sure there will be in the future Just took a knee for you I agree, both these cases surpassed my expectation of mild I\\'m sorry, you absolutely are and vital! ahh enjoy your comp! Best type of vacation cause no guilty feelings for turning into a complete potato. Though I have to clean up, the state of my apartment is.... well, nightshift mess. It was actually my first time working nightshift ever. \\n\\nYeah. I wonder what the world will look like in 2 weeks... or a month? How our daily lives will look like... German study N=9 of viral shedding characteristics in confirmed Covid patients. Very high viral load early in illness, approx 1000 times greater than SARS. At DAY 8 of active symptoms, no longer able to detect active virus in samples, only viral RNA. Only viral RNA in feces, never detected active virus.\\n\\nThey\\'re following up now with N=23 cohort.\\n\\n[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)\\n\\n[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1) I mean the ED is about to go completely bonkers. The EM docs already don\\'t like the turn around time for scans. I suppose outpatient imaging will be down so hopefully that\\'ll make up for the increase in volume. They absolutely *will* fire people.  Hospitals are not run by doctors, they’re run by businessmen. This is exactly how I feel and I am so frustrated. I told him he just needs to wear a mask for each patient. If they run out don’t go in because it’s not worth it for anyone - his patients, his family, his own health given his age and HPN Dynamic control of volume and pressure are required, these are both moving targets that progress as the illness evolves over a few days and under or over doing it causes real harm Well they don\\'t have home reading stations, for starters. Those stations are very expensive. But also radiologists do perform procedures, go down to the ED on occasion for various things related to the scans like consenting people and such. And it leaves the PGY5s kind of out there, in that they\\'ll be the primary folks supervising the PGY4-2s. So it\\'ll be like it is when they\\'re on call except it\\'s during the day and during a pandemic. IDK, I\\'m probably just being irritable. To me it just seems like if from a nursing standpoint all the charge nurses and nurse managers were just like \"Ok guys, good luck! I\\'ll be available by telephone if you need me!\" Anybody have thoughts on how to best utilize home health services if we end up getting a bed crunch?  If people are just requiring supplemental O2 would it not be reasonable to try for early discharge and home management? There are so many things going on at our institution that are making me uncomfortable also. This is not going to go well. This makes a lot of sense While I agree with what you are saying, it’s unfortunate that Respiratory Therapists weren’t mentioned when we are just as on the front lines as you nurses. We’ll be intubating these people. And managing their vents. I don’t have the links at hand but there is a pdf on the CDC website and there are videos from Britain’s NHS out there. Both are good. Also, simply searching YouTube videos from trusted sources (med centers, government agencies, etc) is what I’ve been telling people to do. Anyone doing telehealth in Primary care?  How are you doing your visit coding?\\n\\nI think this is the correct CMS referrence but it is listing codes like 99215.  Does it need a modifier to indicate telelhealth?\\n\\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/TelehealthSrvcsfctsht.pdf so if it\\'s old people and attractive young people, does that mean I\\'m excluded from getting the virus lol *you\\'re You get the local DA office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. this was posted previously:\\n\\nhttps://emcrit.org/ibcc/covid19/#personal_protective_equipment_(PPE) Probably reporting (media) bias. If there\\'s 100 cases,  99 older and 1 attractive young person,  who is the media going to report on? Not saying it doesn\\'t happen,  but these rare cases do seem to be circulated a lot more than the standard ones. I\\'m guessing the fury warrior pulled aggro. Honestly, minimizing risk for ANY healthcare worker is imperative at this moment. Why risk infecting a radiologist who can provide diagnostic support during the coming surge from afar? Unless I’m mistaken, is it essential that they are present in the hospital during the outbreak? We need all hands on deck but that can come in many forms. Unnecessary exposure will just cause more spread and more problems.  You get the local attorney office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. Why can\\'t residents work from home Exactly. We\\'ve not even begun the war against covid, so to speak and we\\'re already dangerously low of PPE. It\\'s reassuring to hear from a fellow colleague with a level head. We need to be protecting ourselves first, and not act heroic and kill ourselves and in turn, other colleagues and patients. OURS. Thanks. We\\'re out here on the front line with no rapid testing and no PPE. There\\'s no other industry in *existence* that would be asked to work under those conditions. You stay home to slow this thing down until someone figures out how to properly protect health care employees.\\n\\nIt\\'s the LEAST we deserve for taking this burden on. Glad to see some action in major cities. I\\'m in NYC, and the streets are getting a bit emptier but not as empty as I hoped. There\\'s still quite a few people commuting to work and hanging out in groups. Public schools are closed and transitioning to online learning until April 20, universities have moved online for the foreseeable future and some have kicked students out of dorms. Restaurants and bars are either closed or takeout/delivery only - many are struggling trying to pay their employees. Nightclubs, movie theaters, and concert venues are closed. We have a covid patient who presented as presumed STEMI later determined to be likely viral myocarditis. My hospital is wasting N95 masks on elective cases today.\\n\\nWe’ve been told over and over - “business as usual”\\n\\nOur elective surgeries continue to flow in. And now, due to concern about ‘aerosolization’, OR staff are being told to wear N95 masks for some of these cases.\\n\\nSo to recap - still doing elective cases. Burning through N95 masks.\\n\\nDoes anyone know if I can make an anonymous Twitter handle and tweet about this without getting doxed? The system here is already fucked because we don\\'t even have enough PPE. We absolutely need to slow down the spread. What characteristics of a ventilator are critical to their function that this would miss?  I know not having them electronically follow the patients\\' breathing patterns is not ideal, but it would seem something that forced them into a regular 4 second breathing pattern would be a better than nothing.  \\n\\n\\nI\\'m talking in a scenario like Italy has where some patients are simply not getting any respiratory support due to a shortage of equipment.  \\n\\n\\nAdding negative pressure rooms to our list. My hospital system is treating everyone with respiratory symptoms as droplet precautions from now until ? LEEEERRROOOOYYYYYYYYYY Neither of these cases seem mild to me, and certainly not enough to blame on a gym workout! Mild enough to blow off to me is a day or two of sore throat and sniffles and back to normal. Sure, but his comment didn\\'t specify that those things weren\\'t taken into account. People with asthma don\\'t necessarily get more severe illness with this strain according to some of the preliminary data. There is not nearly enough data to give you much more than that. one trillion upvotes- more of my questions answered How many lives? This is great. Would you be up for reposting this as a separate thread for maximum exposure? Ha I also have comp after night shift this week. I’m supposed to be in clinic next week but I have no idea what that will look like. Kite them!  Kite them! As a healthcare worker with asthma and also I\\'m fat, how fucked am I?  Other than using recommended PPE, any recommendations?  Nursing staff ain\\'t always the healthiest bunch.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m on a med surg floor once a week. &gt; EDIT: how can I explain to my father that he needs to tell the office manager that it does not make sense to only wear a mask after you’ve been in contact with a patient with COVID-19 and everyone should be wearing one when interacting with patients?\\n\\nYou can\\'t fix stupid China did, then I\\'m not sure if a hunter misdirected, or someone ran away from the group, but theres adds everywhere now What a pisspoor idea. I feel like they are leaving the residents out to dry. Look into how to create negative pressure rooms.  We need a lot more than we have, and working at a suction device manufacturer makes you keenly suited to the task.  Good luck! I personally haven\\'t seen stats that say otherwise. It simply seems the quantity of elderly facing this disease is far overshadowing the numbers in younger people.\\n\\nPercentage wise, younger people are less at risk, but the risk is still non-zero (and seemingly much higher than the flu). Good bot. My department is having daily town hall meetings. Via Microsoft Teams (virtual town hall). pull the fire alarm before it starts? &gt;.&lt; seriously, try to send the message up the chain how bad of an idea that is. We suspended all stuff like that two weeks or so ago. Why are you pissed? It is reddit, you are American until proven otherwise :p\\n\\nbut yeah... unfortunately the global trend seems to follow the US atm... \\\\_sighs\\\\_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should. A lot of churches are doing their services online which is smart. Sounds more like constant emergency 24/7. I\\'m not jealous of them. But I respect the fuck out of their work! Here’s another interesting first hand account of a mild case from someone with confirmed pcr:\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EbethBerkeley/posts/10110434821081713\\n\\nClaimed symptoms paint an interesting picture Hahahaha I did not notice that! I am so not correcting that... On the [This Week in Virology podcast](http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) prof Ralph Baric had the intriguing hypothesis that the endemic human coronaviruses that cause the common cold could have been very serious sars like diseases for adults when initially introduced from animals. This would have the implication that the only reason they are not deadly now is that we develop immunity from exposure as children and then get mild disease as adults when re-infected. If this is true then SARS-2 will eventually become the 3rd human coronavirus that causes just the common cold in people.\\n\\nA highly recommended listen! &gt; Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.\\n\\nHopefully in a few months we\\'ll have a better handle (more PPE, more vents, more beds, more knowledge, more treatment options) on this than we do now... Buying time saves lives. Your message is *super* important, and will hopefully help keep people alive.\\n\\nIn a previous era of life, I had a long and full career in law enforcement.  I used to teach new, young, gung-ho academy graduates that when you\\'re responding to an emergency call, a crime in progress, etc., with lights and siren going, to do the following:  \\nDrive only a small, reasonable bit above the speed limit, and maybe at or below the speed limit.  \\nStop at every single red light and stop sign.  Completely stop.  Wait a second or three.  Look around. Make sure everyone has stopped for you.  *Then* go through it and continue on.   \\nDon\\'t drive faster than the sound from your siren.  \\nStay far enough back from traffic you\\'re coming up to and be patient to let them have time to hear your siren and notice your lights in their mirror(s) and get out of your way.\\nYou **must** be wearing your bulletproof vest, **every** day, no matter the duty, location, season, temperature, humidity, etc.\\nYou **must** get out of your car slowly.  Look around for traffic.  Look around for people.  Stand still and listen.  Wait.  Stand still and listen and look longer.

I know you meant \"re-exposed\" but somehow \"re exploded\" is just as fitting :( It\\'s very sad, but it\\'s not a direct pathology of the disease.

[Position Statement of the ESC Council on Hypertension on ACE-Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers. In the context of COVID-19.](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang)\\n\\n\"13 Mar 2020\\n\\nBased on initial reports from China, and subsequent evidence that arterial hypertension may be associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 infected subjects, hypotheses have been put forward to suggest a potential adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). It has been suggested, especially on social media sites, that these commonly used drugs may increase both the risk of infection and the severity of SARS-CoV2. The concern arises from the observation that, similar to the coronavirus causing SARS, the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs.\\xa0\\n\\nBecause of the social media-related amplification, patients taking these drugs for their high blood pressure and their doctors have become increasingly concerned, and, in some cases, have stopped taking their ACE-I or ARB medications.\\n\\nThis speculation about the safety of ACE-i or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scientific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is no data in humans.\\n\\nThe [Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)) wish to highlight **the lack of any evidence**supporting harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.\\n\\nThe Council on Hypertension **strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the Covid-19 infection.** \\n\\n*Prof. Giovanni de Simone,*\\n\\n*Chair, ESC Council on Hypertension*\\n\\n*On behalf of the Nucleus Members\"* I\\'m not sure what to believe... we have so many reports of young people critically ill, but stats say otherwise... what do you guys think? Obviously this is a question everyone has People need to stop standing in fire I know. It\\'s a terrible situation. World-changing situation. I really don\\'t know what the world is going to look like in a year. &gt; We\\'re being threatened\\n\\nI\\'m not in the US and this is a terrible situation they are putting you in, but they are not going to fire medical staff with this going on.  Stand firm and get your colleagues to stand firm, insist on the PPE or walk out until it\\'s there.  As the post above says you can\\'t help anyone for the time you\\'re down with the virus (or dead) If you\\'re refusing report because you don\\'t have proper PPE, I believe you\\'d win the argument. If you\\'re refusing because you\\'re scared, you\\'d probably lose. In my community, it\\'s the boomers who are flippant about this and think it won\\'t affect them. I just got into it today with one of them about closing her yoga studio and deleting her posts about how wellness based lifestyle can prevent illness... \\n\\nJust to say, please don\\'t turn this into an Us vs Them thing. There are idiots in all age groups. Yep. Analyzing clinical presentation and symptoms does not work well for us. The very first patient tested positive at our ER had nothing more than a sore throat and got tested because he attended a carnival attend which became infamous for spread (at a point where there were still no cases). Guy was a homework tutor at an elementary school, luckily of over 220 tested children and parents none positive but this could have easily gone south if the ER didn\\'t fish him out.  This is all public information revealed in press conferences and articles at this point, if you are concerned about confidentiality. Awesome information! This is just what I was looking for. Now I just need to brush up on my German. Same here lol. Came in this morning and noticed that quite a few of us had shaved clean over the weekend, the initial shock as we saw each other’s beardless faces after years was great. I think they release in the early afternoon (EST). They\\'re going to be spooked by the large increase of +2000 cases since their last sitrep. WHO pulls their US numbers from [CDC\\'s page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html), which is reporting just over 1600 cases while the actual number of positives [sits at over 4100](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en).\\n\\nP.S.

If any mods are reading, I think it\\'s worth a sticky. Does anyone have any experience with appropriate coding/encounter type/billing for telephone encounters? This would be for patients calling for COVID rule-out/guidance as well as possibly folks who have needs that could be met without an in-person visit.\\n\\nTrying to help with an institutional response in a rural area. Thanks! The amount of bull shit I hear from radio hosts in the car is astounding. \\n\\nIt’s more mild than the flu, it’s the media, it’s a left wing political move. \\n\\nIt’s insane that these people are even allowed to make comments about it. I’ve tried to call in to at least warn them that they should leave those kinds of statements to people in the medical field without luck. &gt; Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown?\\n\\nWhat\\'s the goal behind \"shut everything down\"?  Realistically, we are not going to get the infection rate to 0 even if we shut everything down for a couple months.  Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.  The time where a total shutdown is needed is if we get into an Italy or Wuhan situation where the system is overrun.  Then it makes sense to knock the infections down to a point where they can be handled.\\n\\nThe changes that need to be made are the ones that slow the spread while normal life continues.  Shutting everything down is a delaying tactic and not a permanent solution Oh.  Oh boy. I hadn’t been clean shaven in a decade. I look like a high schooler. The inevitable ingrown hairs while my skin adjusts will really complete the teenager look.

Thank you for being human and trying to help out. I don\\'t think your ventilator idea would work, however if your machines can create negative pressure rooms that would be greatly needed. Thanks! I appreciate it. : ) Math is a thing used by epidemiologists, who take into account important things like disease latency, incubation periods, true incidence vs. apparent incidence, etc.\\n\\nNothing about math teaches you that. Only the other way around. I’m about to shave mine. I’m a new attending and look like a med student without it. Working on the ED I don’t think it’s feasible to use the PAPR that often for the number of people I’m gonna have to put on BiPAP or tube.\\n\\nQuestion: are we now assuming every COPD exacerbation has COVID-19 until proven otherwise? Called to a code last night (pharmacist). Our boss said we shouldn’t go to codes of COVID patients bc we are non essential and need to save PPE. We are told to keep the med drawer of the cart outside the room along with rsi kit and hand meds in. I’m not sure what that is going to look like. Last night I asked if isolation patient and the response I got was “not yet”. Arrested at home after a couple days cheat pain. So I go to the code and the MD is fully PPE covered, mask and face shield. No one else is. I’m wondering- are ED physicians just wearing garb the whole shift? I can’t imagine keeping it on and walking from room to room but I am not up there full time so I don’t know. Yah but what are healthcare professionals suppose to do with the lack of prep? The people voted for this current administration... I hope for nurses and doctors sake that they strike after all this. Hard too. They are put at unnecessary risk because of our current state of healthcare. Should be done, thanks for the reminder! I suggest we add an exception to rule #10 specifically for [reacting to healthcare workers who\\'ve had to shave :(](https://giphy.com/gifs/afv-americas-funniest-home-videos-26vUN2RR48dddT1Cg) You do not see patients until you get any. You close down until you do. You can not put yourself at risk. this needs its own thread.. Yes, the number of antecdotal reports is alarming. As of yesterday, the German national status report of the RKI has 3024 cases with full clinical data. Only 39% of these positive tested patients presented with fever! (Source in German: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-03-15-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) I agree 1,000% with you. Just yesterday one of my good friends announced to me that he and two others are taking a road trip south. Mind you they work in NYC, and mind you that just on Saturday they attended a party with 10+ nurses who work at a hospital with confirmed covid. I tried explaining why it was an absolutely horrible and selfish idea to go at this time. He responded \"points taken\" and today I got a picture from a friend of a friend of them on the road. I still can\\'t fucking believe it. I never understood how arrogant and selfish the average American is. What do we do if our hospital has no more P.P.E. What criteria are CDC using for \"recovery\"? There was an internist cheat sheet I saw the other day from Italy that described the above. It basically said don’t trust the first patient rally. I believe a lot of our ignorance is due to the fact of information overload. There are thousands upon thousands of people telling us to do X or Y. One physician says wear masks, another says don’t. Things like these take a toll on the regular American Citizen. Also anyone can post on the internet. Those on the corona subreddit. Or news. Or world news. Are their posts always true? Nope but it’s not like it matters. The moderators on the forums (not even exclusively Reddit), are they healthcare professionals? Nah probably not. Then we turn to the administration, are they professionals? Nah. No, that\\'s not how epidemiology works. If it did, epidemiology wouldn\\'t exist. State of emergency for all of Switzerland. All non-essential stores and public venues closed. Strongly suggested to stay home. Home office if at any way possible. For risk population wages are guaranteed even if home office is not an option. Army will be deployed to help hospitals. Call for all Swiss abroad on vacation to come home. Closing of the borders for non-essential travel.\\n\\nI almost cried. Finally. \\n\\nAlso great somber speech of our president. She emphasized the important points in all 4 languages. With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.  \\n\\nSo in theory while you would have unlimited resources and be in full PPE the reality is going to be healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should. \\n\\nI think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required. \\n\\nMy wife is an ER physician and we have a 4 week old baby. She will likely be returning to work earlier than planned due to the virus.  We are hoping she can stay out at least a few more weeks.\\n\\nStay safe everyone. Humanity\\'s arrogance. Shit like this has happened everywhere. Just look at the members of that church/cult? in SK. We are seeing lots of exhaustion, depression, even suicide in stressed out systems.  I know nothing about this particular case, but non COVID causes are certainly plausible. Agree Hmm. If that is Covid that would be an entirely new presentation.... Myocarditis and arrest is becoming more reported, and more commonly how young folks are dying I am literally in an argument with my best-friend cousin about whether or not this is a big deal. She lives in DC, I live in Seattle. \\n\\nShe is not listening to me. She is angry her son is missing 2 weeks of school. I\\'m worried I might be homeless in 6 months. Or dead. But those are healthy, compliant lungs. Totally different if you have intrinsic lung disease.\\n\\nIt may still come to it, but don’t expect miracles. The wonderful thing about math is that it can be checked by anyone who knows their stuff. Maybe this \"chucklehead\" is a crank, maybe not, but unless you\\'re good at math and have checked their numbers yourself, your dismissal of it seems like another form of anti-intellectualism to me. There were a lot of nerdy people ringing the alarm bell on this disease weeks before the mainstream picked up on it, and I saw a lot of this same \"who made you an expert?\" attitude among people who were in denial up until recently, or even still. I’m glad you’re taking this level of care in your planning. I like all your ideas. I know hospitals that aren’t this regimented! I have nothing to add but I’m so thankful for people like you who are taking it seriously. F [removed] My hypothesis is that the economy is on the verge of crumbling.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n Businesses will go under, leading to layoffs, which will lead to less spending, which will lead to businesses going under,which will lead to layoffs, which will lead to less spending. Shall I continue?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nV 2 of the hypothesis is that they are already aware they must scale back, however the markets are hyper-reactive and emotional so you cannot just announce \\'\\'we\\'re stopping all flights, mandating all businesses closed and a curfew after 6pm\". The trump announcement on european travel ban created a massive drop in the market after hours.\\n\\nThe worrying part is that once it comes out that the hospitals aren\\'t able to help everyone, then we will see the true gruesome nature of this pandemic.\\n\\nIt is right about that time people will realize \\'\\'oh jeez, more serious than I thought\\'\\' I would like a moment of silence for my facial hair - I am going to shave tonight. The one N95 mask I have been permitted to have for each clinical encounter in my clinic needs to do the best it can.\\n\\nI fear my daughter will not know who i am.\\nIf you have went back to looking like a teenager as I will soon do, please offer any words of comfort you may have. \\n\\n\\nF Is there currently a way to test if you have had a previous infection by Covid-19? If not will it be possible in a close future? \\n\\nI figure this will be even more interesting in the coming weeks to understand how the herd immunity status is. And also when a lot of countries are only testing seriously ill patients. I assume the current tests only spill the news of a potential on-going infection? everyone will catch the shit out of this virus AFAIK all the hospitals in Seattle have put a stop those. I\\'m not even bothering to go see my ortho this week. No point now. &gt; For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis \\n\\nHahaha!\\n\\nShit. :( Call your governor’s office.  Local government.  Tell other parents to do the same.  The state superintendent’s office needs to hear your concerns! As a Seattlite, I love that idea. I hate what it means for our city, but I love that idea! she may need to pump and let you give that to them. uptodate mentions trying to be as careful as possible but i can\\'t imagine how you avoid transmission during breastfeeding given the baby is directly in line with your respiration. &gt; But everything floating around is hearsay. \\n\\nWe all need to remember that. I\\'m currently operating under the assumption of higher viral load for HCW causing higher rates of severe disease. All the more reason to adhere to strict PPE. States with any real numbers of cases are taking it seriously. I\\'m in WA and Inslee just closed entertainment places including bars and restaurants. All K-12 are closed, and colleges/unis are doing all online courses through April. I think we\\'re heading for a huge global depression. We MIGHT get a new New Deal out of it, but let\\'s be honest, we don\\'t have much wiggle room right now. We\\'re still in debt as a nation from the last crisis. &gt; IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. \\n\\nThey\\'re not, because they didn\\'t get there using logic. You can\\'t logic someone out of a position they hold due to feelings. Thank you! I remember working the ED for months from the floatpool during the Ebola outbreak. Quarantining half of it for dedicated use on presenting pts. No one panicked, but the hair on the back of your neck sure did raise every time that bell rang for new admission. Just remember, you can\\'t help someone else if you\\'re incapacitated. Stay strong everyone, and take care. I wish people in my fathers office would think this way. The CMO told them that until a provider is actually sick, you should keep seeing patients, even after being exposed to someone with the virus. I have to wonder how many other rural clinics are being this cavalier. &gt; But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.\\n\\nI keep trying to tell people on various subreddits that just because they\\'re sick, that doesn\\'t mean they need to be tested. I just keep getting downvoted. If you know they are exceeding the number limit, report them. They will at least get a nice big fine and hopefully not make idiotic choices again, plus the gathering will be broken up. This is so vitally important. It will require very active suppression of honed clinical muscle memories and learned responses. It will not be easy but it is the only way forward. He’s an elderly petulant child Hey there, I noticed previous threads are often automatically set sort by New, is there anyway to change this thread to do the same? (Thank you again for all you’ve done the past few weeks, and in general!) What are you talking about.  One of Trump\\'s desperate staffers was able to grab his phone and make him tweet, \"Social Distancing!\"\\n\\nThat\\'ll make all of his dumb%#* followers fall in line right? &gt; I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it\\'s pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though people still find a way...\\n\\nAnd Seattle has to keep dealing with that jackass [Tim Eyman](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/coronavirus-daily-news-update-march-14-what-to-know-today-about-covid-19-in-the-seattle-area-washington-state-and-the-nation/), calling for a gathering of \"250 patriots\" to flout Jay Inslee\\'s ban on crowds. &gt;There is no emergency in a pandemic.\\n\\nIf the book *House of God* took place during a pandemic, this would be one of the rules. Possibly an unpopular opinion.  If you choose to go out to bars or travel you should put your name on a list.  People on the list start at the bottom when it comes to the rationing of medical supplies.  If I’m self isolating and not doing anything risky, I should be able to get a vent before a millennial who doesn’t think their actions have consequences. If you were like me you saw tons of people out this weekend. I don’t think we did enough, soon enough. Closing restaurants and bars before the weekend would have really been great, but at this point you have to think it’s coming a little late. But better late than never. I\\'ve been asked to be part of a testing team and the biggest part of my thought process is my 3600 dollar deductible. It is sad that as a health care provider I have to worry about the massive bill that simply doing my job could end up delivering me. Yes, it seems to follow the pattern of looking well enough for discharge then tanking...i only hope there are enough clinicians out there who are aware to be on the lookout for this and can hopefully prevent some cases from slipping through. My mom is super religius and lives in San Diego (not very hard hit yet). Her church cancelled all activities as of last week. I\\'m VERY happy about that!\\n\\nNow if only Seattle could keep Tim Eyman away from the internet and the outside world for 3 months, that\\'d be great. Is there any large scale data on afebrile presentations of covid-19? There seems to be a belief in the general population that no fever=no coronavirus and much of the screening advice seems to focus around fever as well. [This article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article) describes two younger patients, one who was afebrile throughout the course of the disease and one who was febrile for only 3 days. Both had positive PCR results for at least 20 days. My mom and my RN aunt are harping on my elderly mom with COPD to stay away from people. I am not sure she\\'s listening. But she\\'s proud of me!!! Yay. Simplest answer: no one knows. \\n\\nWe were likely too late but we will see in 10-14 days where we are. If we manage to make it through fairly unscathed as a nation then everything we have done will have worked but will be seen by the lay public as overreaction. If it doesn’t work and we end up in an Italy like situation, then I’m afraid the same public will say it didn’t matter what we did, it was gonna happen regardless. \\n\\nIn my opinion, I feel that everyone in the country will directly know personal family with this disease. Stuff like that, given our population now, rarely happens. As stated this is just one guy’s opinion, though &gt; and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiology\\n\\nThere\\'s some chucklehead on /r/CoronavirusWA who keeps posting trend lines of infected and death rates. I asked him why he thought he had the expertise to draw any conclusions from that information, and he said \"I\\'m good at math.\" LOL ok dude. It\\'s to flatten the curve, make sure that people don\\'t all get sick at the same time and overwhelm the medical system.\\n\\nWe\\'re not stopping this. It\\'s out there. We\\'ve just got to get through it and meet on the other side of it. She. But it would be a great name for her &gt; Dr acton\\n\\nFor just a second I thought his name was Dr. Action and I was like, \"Yeah, that\\'s fitting!!\" I\\'ve always said that if I were an evil genius and wanted to eradicate a group of anti-vaxxers that the best intervention would be....convince them not to get vaccines. \\n\\nI think that Covid is the equivalent for anti government and anti-science groups. They will catch the shit out of this virus. Nothing in the news yet but a coworker of his facebooked about it; link to COVID is completely unknown at this time, he had not been known to be ill the day before. Simply found inexplicably dead. Medical device R&amp;D engineer here.  \\n\\nI work for a small suction regulator company  and we\\'re trying to see if there\\'s any way for us to help on the supply chain side.\\n\\nWe\\'re not equipped to help with high volume things like masks and other PPE, but one thing I keep seeing is a shortage of ventilators in the worst hit areas.  Could a low tech \"ventilator\" that oscillates between a specific positive pressure and a weakly negative pressure/atmospheric pressure be helpful at timed intervals be helpful in scenarios where there aren\\'t enough ventilators go around? \\n\\nAre there any other things I should be looking into? Except of course the 50,000 who died. That is of course the problem with percentages is that it is pretty easy to have 18 times the people who died in the Iraq war and 9/11 when you turn it into a percentage. He already said he takes no responsibility We must spread this wisdom ASAP Engineering orgs are often more forward-thinking than healthcare orginazations, as someone who has worked in both That\\'s not how people will look at it though.  It is:\\n\\nOption 1: 4.95% chance of death and a year+ disruption to economic and social life.\\n\\nOption 2: 5% chance of death and we get it over with in a few months.\\n\\nPretty much everyone is going to take option 2. I also work for the NHS and have no intention of going down with the ship (if it\\'s sinking due to lack of PPE).  If we run out of PPE, I am not going near Covid-19.  There are many stories of young healthcare workers getting very ill and dying from Covid even with PPE. It\\'s scary and downright dangerous that the virus has barely scratched the NHS and many trusts are already running low on vital PPE. I\\'m currently reading PFTs (Pulm/CC Fellow) and trying to get my department to cancel all the PFTs and exercise tests. The only part of these that is closed to outside air is the lung volumes, so all these susceptible patients with COPD etc are going to be spraying droplets all over the room with a RT and sometimes a fellow who are going to be badly needed when shit hits the fan. Thanks for posting this. You’ve highlighted my thoughts exactly. The thing is, I (working for the NHS) don’t want to crash along with it. Nor do I want the NHS or the UK to crash, but that’s not something I can control! I have coworkers who are openly talking about having their own big at Patrick’s day party tomorrow at their house because all the bars are closed and in defiance of the 100 person limit in our state. \\n\\nLiterally people who take care of sick trauma \\npatients everyday but their St. Patrick’s day boozefest is more important and then I’m stuck being unable to prevent exposure or spread because they don’t care and I still have to show up to work and work next to them. What are all those naval mercy hospital ships up to?  Is it time to think about recalling them? I cant imagine parking a 1000 bed hospital outside of Seattle would be a bad idea right now. Sobering. Thank you. I\"m seeing this more in the context of people who regularly use NSAIDs. There\\'s a lot of talk about stopping them because if you get sick it would make the sickness worse. For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis or something like that. Truly sobering. Under your scenario, every month we prolong the spread is worth up to 8,000 lives. If they willfully infect the entire population then a year\\'s worth of ICU beds goes to waste, and up to 80,000 people die needlessly.  I really wish people would listen to medical professionals when they tell you lifestyle choices are the number one thing you can do to improve and maintain good health. Instead, many people do what they want and then,  when it hits the fan, they want a magic remedy. \\nI hope In the future we spend more time learning and understanding as patients about public health and our responsibilities to care for ourselves. Fox is like crack cocaine. My coworker has been estranged by his son for several years because of it. He told me \"I\\'m addicted to it. I know that. I can\\'t help it\". I thought it so bizarre he said that. Nothing conclusive (obviously, too early) but data from other coronaviruses indicate 2 year (not lifelong) immunity. I\\'m in love with Amy Acton. \"There are most definitely pros and cons to both\"\\n\\nThe UK plan will result in thousands of people dying who wouldn\\'t have otherwise.\\n\\nEconomic gains will be minimal (If not worse) since the economy isn\\'t just the UK. It\\'s pure Insanity. Stumbled in from the front page. I’m not in the medical field, but this feels so important. I have one meager silver shilling, and you’re getting it kind person. \\n\\nKeep spreading that perspective. It’s massively important in the coming days, weeks, months to not stop spreading this information.\\n\\nI am trying to put myself in the shoes of a healthcare worker, and I know this is something I would need to read too. \\n\\nLove you all, thanks for all you do to keep us safe!  We got this. More so - YOU got this. I’ll do my part in staying home and hope I never have to meet any of you! Ha I did read a theory when this was happening in china that the viral load did influence the severity of illness and they thought this is why young HCWs were becoming seriously ill compared to other young healthy people. Dont know if that has been substantiated, but it makes sense to me. I’m off today but I told my coworkers to print that out and post it everywhere this morning. I don’t know if they did. With the obsession with the stock market and his reported attempt to buy the German company working on a vaccine, there is only a thin veil of pretend leadership hiding the profiteer in chief at this point. Because it looks bad and it\\'s an election year. &gt; It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.\\n\\nThe numbers don\\'t really work, though.  There\\'s ~4,000 ICU beds in the UK and the average ventilator time for a Covid-19 patient is around two weeks.  So max they can treat is 8,000 a month or ~80,000 for the remainder of the year.  In a scenario where half the population is infected and 10% need ICU level care that\\'s 3.3 million patients.  So even a perfectly even spread using all available ICU beds, they can treat ~2.4% of the people that need it.  And that\\'s stopping care for everyone else that needs it.  They run around 80% capacity as is, so if we use excess capacity as the number that 2.4% drops to 0.5%.  \\n\\nIn a \"everyone gets infected\" scenario we\\'re all pretty fucked and a \"let\\'s get it over with\" plan is probably the best. My spouse is FM (and not on reddit) and is working a COVID tent at a major hospital in a major east coast city. The hospital already has a few dozen covid patients under care.\\n\\nThe plan is to use PPE, then come home and  I guess hope for the best. We are both concerned about her contracting and also transmitting to either me or our 6mo son. We have seen anecdotal reports of 10-20% of HCW in Italy contracting, and in this thread about young people (we are both in our 30s) and young doctors essentially dropping dead. Not sure what is real and what isn\\'t.\\n\\nWe\\'ve tried to figure out a way for her to quarantine but that is impossible physically as she needs to breast feed our son. Looking for data and experiences of others in similar situations, trying to navigate this. I\\'ll briefly summarize [this interview of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/gesundheit/coronavirus/virologe-hendrik-streeck-ueber-corona-neue-symptome-entdeckt-16681450.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2) broadsheet with Hendrik Streek, head of the virological institute at the University of Bonn, Germany, who has conducted field research on ca. 100 outpatient/home quarantine Covid-19 patients in the Heinsberg District cluster. As soon I see a publication in English, I\\'ll post the link.\\n\\n* 30% of the cases had diarrhea, way higher than in previous reports\\n* Virus RNA found in toilet bowls with no prove of being infectious\\n* A German 15-min rapid test was a failure with a sensitivity of 33% and a specifity of 93%.\\n* A new reported symptom? Loss of smell and tasting.\\n\\n&amp;#8203;\\n\\n    \"Nearly all infected we conducted interviews with - and those were two thirds of all - described a loss of smelling and tasting for multiple days. This went so far that a mother could no longer note the smell of a full diapper of her child. Others could no longer smell their shampoo and food started to taste dull. We cannot say right now when those symptoms start to present but we believe it is at some later point during infection.\" No. There have been isolated reports here and there, but nothing very credible. Seeing as you\\'d need a large population to be re exploded after recovering, and the entire world has less that 7000 recovered people as I write, that\\'s just not possible. This entire tragedy has shined a huge spotlight on America\\'s arrogance. I\\'ve heard so many outrageous responses to taking this seriously that I\\'m already burned out and the worst is still to come.\\n\\nIt\\'s like the tide has receded and society is more focused on collecting seashells and IG photos while the tsunami is inevitably about to make landfall.\\n\\nJust this weekend I saw a person, who is a realtor by trade, post that COVID was called an upper respiratory infection in December but the media has now decided to give it a name to incite panic. A realtor posted this theory and it was shared / x-posted and liked by many. https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeons\\n\\nThis leaves very little wiggle room. Hit me particularly hard I think all you could do is notify Surgical, nursing and hospital leadership regarding the Policy from the American College of Surgeons.\\n\\nhttps://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeons\\n\\nTheir update leaves little to no wiggle room. What is the rationale for NSAIDs in this disease anyway? Just symptomatic control and anti-pyrexia as usual? I\\'m not sure how avoiding NSAIDs would necessarily be bad per-se. Lowly M-1 who wants to know more.\\n\\nGiven the events and measures taken yesterday, have we done enough?  Were we too late?  How much flattening of the curve did we really achieve with shutting the schools in NYC, banning restaurants, etc?\\n\\nWhat can the general population expect in the coming week-2 weeks? What possibly could be? \\n\\nIt it truly just slowing the spread is all we can hope for? Share the hotlines on those posts. People should be calling ahead to get instructions, and yes, that night take a while, but this isn\\'t a fast killer for anyone getting turned back. It takes getting I\\'ll and deteriorating in week 2 to need hospital management, that\\'s all time to call the hotline. Got a link? I don\\'t see anything on google news about this. Large healthcare organizations aren\\'t doing WFH due to organizational inertia and \"it\\'s not in our values\".  How can we expect other companies to do it? Such amazing adviceX thanks for sharing Is it because it wasn\\'t implemented soon enough? my god in heaven what are they waiting for.......i really cant believe it at this point Not enough data. Same as ACEi/ARB. And to be fair the same as all the proposed antiviral treatments - we just don’t have firm evidence yet. Everyone thinks that they\\'re the \"special case\" and that they deserve different care than what is recommended for everyone else.  Sorry you have to deal with this. extremely irresponsible. my quaternary level facility has suspended all elective cases with only urgent procedures being done. the surgeon general and the american college of surgeons has said the same. although, i think it would depend on if there were any COVID positive cases in your area as well.  the ITaly situation showed they went from 1 positive to overwhelmed in the matter of weeks It\\'s hard as hell, but it is important to remember the first step of every layperson CPR algorithm is to make sure the area is safe for you before going in. In this case, that means you absolutely take the time needed to make sure you don all your PPE properly. Multiplying victims helps no one. If your team becomes infected, what happens to the next patient that needs you? And the one after that? This seems like the course that is described for young people. Recovery followed by death from myocarditis. Wage caps at $2M, 1000% luxury goods tax, 100% inheritance tax above $6M, all essential products under government production/control, public service wage caps at $120k and no holding private investments, term limits of two years, ranked choice tele-voting automatic registration, educators paid more than fund managers, ubi, social security at 55, any for profit organizations profit caps at 25%/yr or 100%taxed. Buy me a hotdog, with, with sauerkraut and onions. The alarming thing is that isolation and shutdown are not thought to be enough to stop this. I am tempted to agree that it\\'s not a good idea, but I\\'m not sold completely by the total lockdown Singaporean style approach either. It works in the v short-term, medium and long term you have to be skeptical. \\n\\nJust a note to say I don\\'t think the UK government want infection rates to \"maximise\" in any sense, they want to manage the rate in the \"unlikely to need ICU\" population (How possible that is, I have no idea). Concurrently, I think they do plan on implementing an asian country style \\'lockdown\\' but just for \"likely to need ICU\" population.\\n\\nAs stated previously, I\\'m just trying to ascertain the logic here and am not advocating for any particular approach. There are most definitely pros and cons to both. This came up a few times in this megathread over the weekend, but I\\'ve yet to see any evidence either way -- i.e. that it does or does not make a difference. One person over the weekend said that there was a message going around about a study from the University of Vienna (I think? somewhere in Vienna) that suggested that all of the sickest Italian patients had been taking NSAIDs. But the institution in Vienna immediately debunked that. The French health minister was saying this about NSAIDs. And supposedly it had to do with ACE. But everything floating around is hearsay. \\n\\nI don\\'t know, I have a lot of people asking me about it and I have absolutely no information either way. jeeze im crying I agree that if this strategy has any hope of working, our \"Likely to need ICU admission patients\" need to isolate ASAP and this needs to be enforceable by law. At least 20 something states have cancelled school. Im sure yours will happen at some point this week. Governors having FOMO left and right (for good reason!) I would say the lack of foresight is frightening but we don’t need foresight...look at China, Iran and Italy. Why do we seem to think we are above it? I’m at a loss. The schedules for the rest of the week are even busier. Yea a family friend is having surgery this week. She\\'s almost 60 and has CKD, DM, HTN, etc.  Like why the fuck is this happening?! I\\'ve tried repeatedly to tell her daughter to get her reschedule but she thinks the whole thing isn\\'t a big deal so my concerns are falling on deaf ears. I\\'m trying to figure out why the hospital is doing it anyways. Here in the midwest we haven\\'t been hit hard yet but it\\'s coming and we\\'re gonna need all the PPE for emergent surgeries, not elective shit now. It feels so to me. My hospital is the same. The schedule today has elective add ons! It amazes me. Our OR is filled with elective cases today. No one seems to care here or elsewhere. Why are we ignoring this? This is the truth: years of training and experience cannot be replaced by books. \\n\\nPlease make sure the knowledge is passed on Are you suggesting COVID was the cause of his arrest? Can someone, anyone, answer me WHY domestic flights have not been grounded yet? Yeah that too.  Information is power, the right information can have big results with minimum expenditure. I only address misinformation if it is dangerous/harmful.  Otherwise people can do whatever they want.  That cuts out most of the work right there. It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.\\n\\nThe UK instead is going to maximize the infection rate, overwhelm their health care system quickly, and thereby maximize the amount of casualties. They may shorten the duration of their overall outbreak by a few months, at the price of tens of thousands of lives. Oh that’s terrible. Poor guy. Is this the exact reason patient 31 was such a super spreader? From the salt spraying? It was very brutal. Rip xia And he took out the public health career politician bs and just put a straight doctor in charge of who he listens to. Dr acton My hospital is still allowing a ton of elective surgical cases. Is this as irresponsible as I think it is? I feel like I should refuse to participate in elective cases The NSAID thing is going around Facebook fwiw Do we have a conclusive opinion on the post infection immunity ?\\n\\nAnd well wishes from Africa. Dismantling the NIH pandemic response office should be criminal with these results. Lives are and will be lost,  not even mentioning economic impacts. Leadership should be held accountable by the people but it seems like we are too far gone for that in this country. I think this is what they are going for as well.\\nI am extremely skeptical for multiple reasons. Firstly, the virus has proven itself extremely contagious. They are not currently doing anything to prevent its spread, and elderly people are not forced into self isolation. So...it\\'s spreading like wildfire right now through every age group. Personally I feel this will overwhelm the NHS within 2-3 weeks.\\n\\nThey\\'re also playing a dangerous game with trying to infect the \"healthy\" people as that will still come at a cost - 25 year olds still die of Covid-19. They are less likely to die, but doesn\\'t change the fact that they are certainly sacrificing lives for this \"herd immunity.\"\\n\\nI am also skeptical of herd immunity. Is there any evidence that you even develop immunity to this virus? There have been multiple reports of people who have been positive, then get better and are negative, becoming positive again.  Plus it seems that just like influenza it would be easy for a slightly different strain to come around and make though thousands to hundreds of thousands of people you let die for her immunity utterly pointless.\\n\\nAnother interesting thought I saw brought up is that since most other countries are going for the total lockdown eradication route, does this not mean they will have to stop all travel to and from the UK for the foreseeable future? Our current plan is let everyone get infected. If the plan continues for a year, which they think it will, surely that means any country that has stopped the virus via isolation would not allow someone from a country letting it run free come in.\\n\\nOverall, I see why they are trying to mitigate economic effects. I just can\\'t get behind the plan, and I do not see the NHS coping for very long. Well, not all countries have factories making ppe under their command.\\n\\nNow my Utopia on Earth has a strong advanced Heath system and manufacture everything so no imports. Anyone would like to add to my Utopia ? We all need this reminder.  Thank you. Thank you for this. It becomes very concerning when all over the US, we are running out of PPE very quickly. We may get more in the long term but in the short term, the decisions are even more difficult right access to proper PPE. So CDC is recommending no gatherings of 50+ people, yet schools do not count. Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown? Cases are increasing rapidly yet we\\'re pussy footing around and letting people do whatever they want to a large degree. It\\'s so frustrating that we\\'ve seen the results of dragging feet from China and Italy and think we will magically not have the same outcomes. &gt; What has happened to America?\\n\\nIt was made great.\\n\\nI know we prefer shying away from politics, but this fish rotted from the head from day 1. My wife is going through the same thing.\\n\\nVery disheartening to her when the people who brag about her to their friends, completely ignore the topic they brag about. Guess what news channel is on 24/7?\\n\\nWe\\'re going to try one more time tonight. We\\'re hoping we can spin it as we need them to set an example for those around because this is a dangerous situation for my wife. &gt;I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.\\n\\nWait, what?\\n\\n*Clicks link*\\n\\n...Oh. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection\\nThis article states that NSAIDS are supposedly worsening the symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Is there any pathophysiological understanding of why that is? Typically NSAIDS can cause damage to the GI system or renal system, how can it worsen respiratory symptoms? I have been very intrigued by the seemingly slow UK response and the reasons behind it. \\n\\nHaving had a think, I think the reason may be about finding a compromise between the health and financial impacts of the pandemic: \\n\\nIf non vulnerable people contract the virus (20-50 year olds, no comorbidities) they are unlikely to need ICU admission. Therefore we are not v worried about them getting it. \\n\\nIn fact, we want them to get it at a steady rate so we can get them back to being fully fledged members of the economy: working, purchasing etc. They get the virus, they self-isolate for a period and then ideally behave normally. This will be facilitated by widespread rapid home-testing kits, production of which is being accelerated as we speak. \\n\\nMeanwhile we hide away the vulnerable (this group will be defined further in the next few days ie not just over 70s) as they are the ICU admission risk. They are locked away until the Ro drops below one due to the development of \"herd immunity\". \\n\\nI believe the economic risk is the reason for the aversion to a \"lockdown\" type strategy, not negligence.\\n\\nAny thoughts? Agreements/Disagreements?\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is necessarily the correct response but I think its what they are going for. My shop began creating cohort units yesterday. ICU, stepdown, med/surg. Shit\\'s getting real now.\\n\\nFacebook meme status report: less \"it\\'s just flu\" and more \"kids staying at home is the end of my life\". St. Florence Nightingale posting remains hot. Toilet paper memes growing tired and losing value, but still pushed hard by Facebook neophytes. Our government has called for a voluntary ban on gatherings that church services would fit into. However, I think there would be a literal armed revolt if the government tried to actually ban church services. Interesting video about what Nanjing has done to stop the spread:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsdJGj3-jM\\n\\nBiggest things I see are temperature check points everywhere, masks everywhere, and lots of little sensible things like tissue to touch the elevator buttons and not allowing face to face seating at restaurants.  \\n\\nI\\'m also sure it will warm everyone\\'s heart to see that fast food workers in China have better PPE than medical workers here. So what\\'s the deal with NSAIDs?  Good, Bad, Not enough data? Or spending $0.00 to make an announcement directing people to isolate themselves. # Current Covid-19 stats: \\n \\n* Total reported cases: 173,833  \\n* Total reported deaths: 6,680 \\n* Total reported recoveries: 77,826 \\n* Estimated death rate: 3.84 u/Number_Bot !Coronavirus Christ, that was brutal. \\nnot 2T into masks and ventilators, mind you I honestly don\\'t understand people sometimes.  There is a TON of information out there that unless if you are incredibly sick, don\\'t come in to the ED just to see if you have coronavirus.  Even if you have a known exposure, if your symptoms are mild, you are to call either the state hotline or the hotlines set up by the major health systems near me.  But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.  For one of them, my nurse basically asked them if they thought it was a good idea to come in and expose all of us if they did have it, or if they should just call the hotline like is recommended.  They basically said they didn\\'t know if the hotline open during the middle of the night... hopefully your husband\\'s boss is pressured to implement WFH, and soon This is so infuriating. You are so correct about our need for meaningful code discussions ahead of time. I’ll have to look on SHM if they have recommendations but it may be something for rounders to discuss daily. Thanks for the response. Stay safe! This post is for my healthcare workers, docs, surgeons, Nurses, aids, and ems, but also support staff.\\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic\\n\\nYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you\\'re going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You\\'re going to have to put your needs first.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed)\\nBut your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves.\\nYou stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.\\n\\nYou going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any  patients in the weeks your laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.\\n\\nPeople are going to die. Do not become one of them. \\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\\n\\nDuring the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter, before going in. If we didn\\'t have proper PPE we did NOT go in.\\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\\n\\nYou may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPE\\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\\n\\nYou may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.\\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\\n\\nYou may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.\\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\\n\\nA self qaurentined patient has a gun shot wound and is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPE\\n\\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic \\n\\n\\nMany of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn\\'t be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient. \\n\\nLiberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.\\n\\nThen they became infected, they infected others. And they died.  They didn\\'t help anyone after that.\\n\\nDo not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten. I live in Ohio. I’m not a fan of Mike DeWine, but he has been excellent thus far. Leading the way in shutting down sporting events, schools, restaurants, and bars. I expect a complete state shutdown in the next day or two. Everything he has done has been backed by his head of the Ohio Department of Health. The federal government has sucked. Some state governments are doing a good job. When I used to counsel and people would bring these things up, I \\nwould encourage them to really do their own in depth research into it... really look into who is \"conducting\" the research and who is \"publishing\" the info- oftentimes it is the company themselves or a company they\\'re paying so there\\'s a financial incentive to make things look good- that line sometimes gets some people thinking. Bringing up the fact that there\\'s no one actually vetting the product and some studies have shown that many supplements dont actually contain the amount they claim on the bottle occasionally helps (not as much as you would think). Explaining that treatment plans are very tailored to the individual and these people dont actually set what\\'s going on with the pt or what they\\'re taking may interact/cause side effects with their meds or disease state may also rope some people.  Things that hit home are when you can relate the situation to something the patient can understand. One of my faves is, \"would you turn to an accountant (or your Aunt Jane) to give you advice on how to fix your car? No, so why take the chance with your body?\" In the case of Dr. Oz, \"how comfortable would you feel asking a heart surgeon to operate on your brain?\" (or something related to the patient\\'s field of work- \"Would you ask the guy who only does oil changes on passenger cars to fix your big rig?\"). Yikes. Only consolidation I can offer is there\\'s about a 98% chance that flight will not be permitted come Saturday. That’s rough.  Code discussions with patients have never been so important.\\n\\nCrash carts around suspected should have PPE in their IMHO.\\n\\nItaly intubates early, as they have seen a fairly predictable pattern of aggressive crumping after a few days of illness You have to allow people a little leeway to engage in bullshit. These are stressful times and people will often double down on vices to manage that stress. If homeopathic bullshit is their jam then they’ll probably look to that. \\n\\nI think the main question is whether the horse shit treatment is harmful or not. For example if someone is taking high levels of an herb/mineral/etc that can cause other health problems to arise, or if they are not taking proper precautions and exposing themselves to risky situations because they think they are immune or whatever. \\n\\nThe bottom line is to stress the fact that we know very little about this virus and there is no currently recognized cure(homeopathic or otherwise) and that all of us still need to practice proper sanitation and social distancing. Bars were packed on Saturday night in Boston despite everyone being urged to self-isolate. Now our governor has issued restrictions limiting restaurants and bars to take-out orders only. I fear it\\'s already too late. Gatherings are now limited to 25 people, but my husband still has to go to work in an engineering office with a lot more people than that. Everything is confusion. Have any experts discussed how in the future we can determine how long the social distancing measures and other efforts need to last? Right now we probably can\\'t know how long this needs to go on because we don\\'t know exactly how it\\'s going to spread, but as the weeks and months roll by how can we determine that we have effectively flattened the curve and we can start going back to business as usual?\\n\\nWhat sort of measures will they be looking at - total number of current and resolved cases? Daisychaining of ventilators in Vegas during the shooting - 8 patients per vent.  It’s been done, but was only for short periods.\\n\\nThey were lucky as hell they had a military doc working that night, I can’t imagine what the outcome would have been otherwise.\\n\\nhttps://epmonthly.com/article/not-heroes-wear-capes-one-las-vegas-ed-saved-hundreds-lives-worst-mass-shooting-u-s-history/ That or the late onset viral myocarditis that’s uncommon but is appArently a thing Nurse who works at a psych crisis center (think psych-only ER) in the US. I’ve barely worked at the place a year but the more senior nurses have quit and I’m known as a smarty-pants who they will look to for guidance.\\n\\nFacility is a 23 hr institution so only day chairs for napping, no beds, communal bathrooms and showers. Barely any PPE. No true isolation rooms whatsoever. Patients are usually two to a room so the best we could do is keep 1 patient to a room at a time... but there’s only 8 rooms. Max capacity is 17 for the entire unit.\\n\\nWe get patients who are walk-ins, police drop-offs from the community, and referrals from hospitals. Leadership is struggling to find the right balance of staff safety, patient safety, and infection prevention. Our population and frequent flyers include a lot of older homeless people with chronic coughs. (Fuck.)\\n\\nI have suggested the following:\\n\\nPatients cleared by the hospital must present as afebrile and cough, if present, must be infrequent and the patient needs to be coherent enough to know to cover with his elbow and follow up with hand washing.\\n\\nPatients from the community (including police drop-offs) may enter through the back constables office where we have a separate shower. The patient will be checked for fever and cough; if cleared by nursing, the patient must immediately shower and change into our paper scrubs. Temperatures are checked twice each shift on EVERYONE.\\n\\nThe problem we run into is that our population is not always compliant. Already, we had a schizophrenic from home enter in a catatonic state whose arms/legs were rigid and we couldn’t change him into scrubs, let alone shower him. Then he tried to run out the door and needed a B52 so then we got to keep him, yay.\\n\\nThoughts? Advice? Help. What’s the safest I can keep my psych cuties and my co-workers? LOL What do you mean done nothing? They cut the short interest rate to zero and injected $2T into the markets. /s Seeing posts shared on the lovely Facebook about people trying to get tested in the US and being turned away with a giant hospital bill. I know people here were discussing that this whole thing should increase the population’s trust in the medical system but I’m worried that’s going to completely backfire. Heard about a 35 year old  intensivist dying in Indianapolis yesterday with OOHCA after his shift caring for multiple critically ill patients. \\n\\n\\nThoughts are with his family and colleagues. I’ve spent way too much of my time over the last several days fighting misinformation among my friends on Facebook (I even reactivated my account to do it). I don’t have a canned response but I’m just trying to calmly point out inaccuracies and include links. I’ve even included some journal links when it seemed appropriate, rather than press or things written for lay readers. \\n\\nIME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. But the people who just dabble in whatever they hear about are often happy right now to hear from a doctor who knows what they’re saying. I try to stick only to facts but I do get asked advice and I only give with a lot of caveats and also I keep saying the facts are the best I have but some might be wrong and I’ll update if they are. It’s a complicated line between seeming expert enough for people to take me seriously and making sure I don’t say anything that isn’t true or good advice. I was wondering this as well Question. Attended my first RRT for a patient under precautions with test results pending that night (came back positive today). Severe respiratory distress that happened extremely fast as we waited way too long for PPE. How is everyone stocking crash carts and RSI kits? Our N-95 stock is under lock and key with the house supervisor so no masks were present and PAPR was not on floor. Initially called a code and I cannot imagine if they were truly in cardiac arrest because it took 5+ minutes to get the bare minimum of PPE. It was honestly shocking how fast they went downhill and I never want to be staring at someone threw a window going into that level of distress and anxiety again and not be able to do something because PPE isn’t readily available. I’m trying my best to fight misinformation in my social media circle. Breaking down medical stuff for the layperson in a calm, polite way is my jam. However, when I encounter folks advocating or inquiring about Goop/Dr. Oz “remedies” like essential oils, I struggle.  Obviously, telling these folks that their remedy is horseshit would likely lead to them doubling down on said horseshit.  \\n  \\nDoes anyone have any good ideas for this situation? Would love to put together a canned response I can tweak as needed. (I know I probably won’t change these people’s minds, but would like a measured response that won’t inflame them, and would leave the door open to further education.) That picture of Magic Kingdom last night is deeply unsettling. The airport photos concerned me but those people were mostly stuck unwittingly. The fact that so many people chose to go to Magic Kingdom, though . . . \\nIs that really from last night? they still basically have not done jack shit up to this point I don’t work in the medical field but my brother is an ER doctor(hasn’t seen any COVID19 cases yet to the best of my knowledge), but these reports of ER doctors falling critically ill has me worried. \\n\\nIs the reason why these doctors fell critically ill just the luck of the draw from contracting the virus itself? Or are medical workers at a higher risk for severe cases because they may be exposed to heavier viral loads if they are around lots of people with the virus all day? \\n\\nI saw someone suggesting the latter on a tv show I watched about the doctor in Wuhan who sounded the alarm and then died(he was only in his 30s). Though I have some suspicions that his real cause of death may be the Chinese communist party. If your country hasn\\'t yet banned gatherings of people in the dozens, especially churches, make sure they do!\\n\\nHere in South Korea we\\'re starting to get over the SCJ cult cluster but now we have multiple small clusters linked to churches. One church sprayed salt water into the mouths of attendees in the belief that it would kill the virus. Of course people coughed onto the nozzle when the salt water hit their tonsils and there are now 40+ cases linked to that church\\n\\n/facepalm This is why the government has to step in and force shit to be shut down. A considerable portion of the population will ignore the warnings and recommendations, and in a situation like this you really need full compliance. I started wondering this last night myself. Came across this [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html?fbclid=IwAR3cjqojQTsW4wPmETYoNkywPuNXSUDNXy5ronkb9nouuV165RNoJbZRhYE) profiling two 29 year old HCWs from China- one doctor and one nurse- and their trajectory after being diagnosed. It\\'s a sobering reminder that although some of us may not fall into higher risk categories,  it\\'s still important to protect ourselves as much as possible in the coming days. I saw a great quote this week that summed up this feeling for me “a week ago, no one had heard of coronavirus or an epidemiologist and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiology.” It’s on both extremes, panickers and deniers couldn’t care that you might actually know something factual as an MD. I need to rant. My wife is being induced tomorrow. Her parents are still planning to go to Cabo on Saturday. I’ve told them virus danger, bringing it to their elderly parents, border lockdown (turning 1 week into 3+) and also how they aren’t to see us for 2 weeks after being on US soil. Totally unfazed. Usual boomer responses- it’s the flu, I feel fine, I’ve lost enough money in the market don’t wanna lose the trip, and the more infuriating ‘you work in a hospital, i think that’s more dangerous’. I’m so beyond pissed. I’m pissed that MDs have lost their authority in this country. Any idiot can put whatever they want on FB, do whatever they want with their bodies and it’s all ok. Question concerning surfactant application:  \\nAs far as I know surfactant has proven ineffective in \"usual\" adult septic ARDS due to the complexity of the problem. However I just read that sars-coV-2 attacks the surfactant producing type 2 pneumocytes. Considering the fast pacing collapse of alveolae wouldn\\'t a (possibly repeated) application of surfactant aerosol help keeping them open?   \\nDoes anybody know wether this is being reevaluated? \\n[–]Chayoss\\nN\\nM\\nH\\nP\\nMB BChir - A&amp;E/Anaesthetics/Critical Care[F,S,M] 21 points 22 hours ago stickied comment \\nPlease remember that this subreddit is for medical professionals; personal health situations and layperson questions are not permitted, and the rules on the sidebar all apply here.

The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”\\n\\n&gt; The document also states that:\\n\\n&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.\\n&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.\\n&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t necessarily the most likely scenario, but it\\'s rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.\\n\\n* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):\\n\\n&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.\\n\\n&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.\\n\\n* I think it\\'s pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don\\'t want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn\\'t really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I\\'ve also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):\\n\\n&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.\\n\\n* Jack Ma, co-founder of China\\'s enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s).

I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it's pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though [people](https://www.ft.com/content/4ee1bef8-652b-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5) [still](https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1239403796947755009) [find](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981#block-5e6f41548f085c6327bc0981) [a way](https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus)...* Staying on the topic of terrible ideas, [new airport screening measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/airports-coronavirus.html) were clearly not properly thought through, cramming thousands of travelers into confined spaces for extended durations:&gt; Wait times as long as seven hours at O’Hare on Saturday night came in the wake of a new policy toward travelers returning from European countries, who went essentially from zero screening on Friday to “enhanced screening.” “I found it a little ironic they had so many people waiting in the same area,” said Genevieve Couldwell, a doctoral student who lives in Salt Lake City and flew from London to New York on Sunday. “We went through this whole process only to be kept in a situation where there might have been more exposure.”* [Leaked documents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised) from Public Health England project a fairly bleak year for us:&gt;The document says that: “As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.”&gt;The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work “in essential services and critical infrastructure” will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”&gt; The document also states that:&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.This isn't necessarily the most likely scenario, but it's rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.* I think it's pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don't want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn't really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I've also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.* Jack Ma, co-founder of China's enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s).

       "'Hanging in there, thanks! Hope you are well. Main tank died, do we have any battle rez left? I concur. Elbow bumps from Stockholm, Sweden. Stay safe and take care! It\\'s been a week since this comment. So much has changed in that week that I want to ask, how are you doing? Are you hanging in there? Now it looks like the US is tanking :/ Doesn’t matter if you burst through the wall like the koolaid man to save a battered wife in a domestic violence incident, if you aren’t paying attention and she stabs you in the neck with a kitchen knife (which actually happens a whole lot. Violent dysfunctional couples are weird...) Absolutely agree on the feelings but that’s totally the point. Best life lesson I’ve learned in my (non medical) career is “if you feel the need to rush, slow down and back up”. It’s what saves you from mistakes, especially when stakes are high. And it’s easier when it’s constant, in a weird way. When you have one memorable event a week or day its easy to feel like you have to rush in and fix everything. When it’s a shitstorm when you show up and you know it’ll still be a shitstorm when you leave, you show up, put on your gear, and follow the damn procedures. As an ER medic in an almost no resource environment, thank you. [deleted] Those would definitely be very much needed for these patients. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is the feared complication of COVID-19, and needs specific parameters for ventilation. If you want numbers the protocol is called ARDS-NET. Yes, 100% oxygen would be a huge issue. The hospital oxygen sources I\\'ve seen are all flow restrictive as opposed to pressure regulators, so that wouldn\\'t work for this.  Plus you\\'d be ventilating your patients with 100% oxygen without a compressed air source, risking oxygen toxicity.Sorry typo: meant once per 4-6 seconds, not 4-6 times per second.  We had a call with a respiratory therapist yesterday evening who said being able to tweak the rate and limit the compression of the ambubag would be his primary concerns. No, most rooms in a hospital have an oxygen hookup. 4-6 times *a second?!* Where are you reading this?! Also PMing you my work email so I can respond quicker Thanks!    From what I\\'ve been able to gather, positive pressure/compressed air/medical air is generally only available in ORs, correct?  Another idea I\\'ve been looking into is trying to automate an ambu bag/bag valve mask.  I\\'ve got a prototype built where I cannibalized parts from our intermitting suction regulators to be able to drive a piston up and down to compress an ambubag in the 4-6 times per second range the internet says is standard.  What concerns might you have with this concept? ICU RN here, I just want to say thank you for this. I\\'m going to  share this with my co-workers and RN friends. What you said is so significant and profound; I have found some comfort in your words, thank you truly. Powerful reminder If you have questions after reading the link someone else provided, let me know. Would be happy to discuss with you. You could make \\'em last a bit longer by wearing a surgical mask over your N95... if you have them. No nebs.What are you guys doing with regards to intubation? Do you have PPE? they started it That\\'s what I was trying to say. Didn\\'t realize this would have started a whole chain of comments/arguments *(I was thinking of the annoucement headline from the Telegraph: \"Boris Johnson shutdowns UK\" - of course, that\\'s not technically correct either)*I\\'ll correct my comment. don\\'t encourage homicide unfortunately good information isn\\'t contagious I’d climb a mountain of bodies to make it to the polls this year, COVID virus or not. &gt;  Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union.They\\'re bluffing and we need to call their bluff. Things are only going to keep getting worse until ordinary people organise better and yes risk their jobs to stand up for better treatment.Also please vote... I\\'m not telling you who to vote for, just vote. You misunderstand. He\\'s not *reading* the book, he\\'s trying to *write* the book. I never said the argument for unions was anything but strong; I agree with you about that. My point is that you put your job in serious risk if you attempt to organize your workplace. If you don’t have a 100% perfect record with attendance, zero customer complaints, perfect reviews, etc., then you can 100% count on getting fired or finding your hours cut to 3 a week if you’re part time. And lots of employers aren’t above faking bad reviews or attendance records.  A general strike will only result in millions of terminations. Most companies would rather go out of business than deal with a union. That\\'s like asking someone how he knows what the weather is without being a meteorologist. Actually, it\\'s worse: it\\'s questioning how someone can know what a book says without being an expert, when all that is required is literacy. Right... so again you\\'re just making the argument for unions stronger.    Since the 1980s when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers there has been a continuous effort to reduce the power of unions and make them irrelevant chipping away at them bit by bit.  We need something like a general strike to get laws on unions changed. See all those people out there in the public with masks? Yuppers. And since we are low on PPE when we are out we go home.... Of course it’s illegal to fire someone for trying to organize. They’ll either find some other way to get rid of you (cutting hours, putting you on the graveyard shift, giving you an impossible workload that will inevitably lead to failure, transfer to their Alaska HQ, etc) or they’ll just fire you as an example to the other workers of what happens when you try to organize.  They’ll consider any fines to be money well spent, if it keeps a union out of their workplace.Edit:  they can and will fire as many people as possible to prevent organization.  If I means shutting down for a week while new workers are hired, so be it.  They’ll do anything and everything necessary to keep a union out, even if it means closing a location. Again this is why we need unions.  If enough people support a union they can\\'t fire everyone.  Anyway depending on which state of the USA it\\'s illegal for them to fire you for discussing a union with your colleagues. You need to be careful, though. In the USA your employer will usually fire you for even contemplating the concept of a union if they find out, if you’re not already covered by one. And if you *do* manage to organize your co-workers, they’ll just shut down your site, like Walmart did/does. ... at which point they will entirely un-ironically shout \"you should\\'ve warned us this would happen!\" Probably also \"you should\\'ve been more prepared!\"Well, you did, and you tried as best as they\\'d let you. I\\'m not sure about full recovery, but at least enough for a hospital to discharge them. Yeah you know this is exactly why unions exist and need to exist.  Support the unions in your industry! The mask is literally my only protection... 30mg is equivalent to about 650mg acetaminophen IIRC. But it\\'s better for pain as far as I know. mdi with spacer is the correct answer. This is horrifying. Thank you for the summary im just basing it off of stories of people being re-infected being very rare, despite the chances of you getting it twice is probably pretty high. If you think about how many tests have been taken, its likely that they weren\\'t all perfect, therefore the people who are allegedly getting it twice are probably just people who had inaccurate tests the first time or something like that. If you could get it again I reckon it would be common knowledge by now idk. Take all the data you see with a pinch of salt, this is the internet Please don\\'t re-write history here. China did not let WHO or other agencies come in until it was MUCH later. They blocked their own scientists and doctors from speaking up early on which led to the spread of this virus. They are not a shining example of anything. In addition, I\\'m not sure anyone believes that their numbers were as low as reported. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if it was actually in the millions. Do you really believe that not a single Chinese military member got infected? That being said, of course we will study this after the fact and find the best practices from each country. Let\\'s see how how we handle this surge in our ICU\\'s - and what effect the current restrictions have - before we judge ourselves as failures. Or is it anti retro viral use? And if we count in how many people are going to die as a consequence of that economic fallout, how many suicides, broken marriages etc...Both strategies have a bad ending and it is not clear which ending is worse. Hi all,Paramedic from Australia here.Just looking for some advice/ideas on the risks involved with prehospital management of infective exacerbation of COPD. A mainstay of our prehospital care of exacerbation of COPD is salbutamol/ipratropium bromide nebs. Obviously this is now a high risk procedure going forward, any recommendations in change of practice? PMDI use with spacers seems to be the logical decision for prehospital management however at this time our service is limited to salbutamol. Any other ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Stay safe out there! &gt; because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.Why would that be? The clinical significance and direction of the upregulated ACE2 is still ???. There\\'s mouse studies suggesting ACE2 is protective vs acute lung injury. Just want to clarify the 260k deaths is real bad but the real problem is the peak ICU demand 8x of surge capacity The us could accomplish many o the same things but had chosen not to  This will be a crazy case study with chapters upon chapters upon chapters on how we screwed up from not letting the WHO help US, not listening to medical professionals and experts, and just...its frustrating. Not to mention that the people’s mindset in the US vs countries like China are different. The US is more of a .....individualistic look out for myself type mindset?  I’m curious to see where this lockdown will lead Then they’ll just whine about PPE not being available when called on it.  Meanwhile, they don’t give a damn about their workers, and their lawyers can beat up your lawyers. Hi all!This is somewhat self-promotion, but it\\'s for a good cause and we need medical volunteers so I thought I\\'d post it anyway.  I built a website that allows people who want to volunteer/work to fight coronavirus connect with those that need help, be they hospitals, research labs, or even households. People sign up, and, in a couple of days, those that need volunteers can put in their location and we will provide them with a list of people nearby. Anyone in the US can sign up. If you are interested in helping, please volunteer, upvote or share. Website:  [https://endcovid.org/volunteers/](https://endcovid.org/volunteers/) I think we already realize that, while China\\'s response is impressive. We can\\'t replicate it, China is another beast. Most of the essential resources to implement their plan is already at their disposable or they are able to make them.I think it\\'s ironic that the things that make us describe China as a dystopia. Are things that helped them control the outbreaks. From their Extensive Mass Surveillance System, being the factory\\'s of the world, asia\\'s collective culture in general, to the gov complete authority over the people.They built a hospital in 7 days, were able to manufacture whatever they need from PPE to Ventilators, according to the WHO\\'s mission CT scan is done in 10 mins.CCP realized what needs to be done and had the power and resources to do it.I hate to admit it but we have to acknowledge China\\'s points of strength.And I hope that we learn from their strength in the future.However, I think that we should look into Singapore and South Korea\\'s Response.Both are Democracies who are successful in limiting the spread. I also think that it\\'s likely that China will have a second wave but it will be ready for it or maybe be able to prevent it till a vaccine is available. This comment brought the scene in saving Private Ryan to my mind, where they are Omaha and talking about leaving people to move onto someone you can actually save. I\\'m curious about everyone\\'s thoughts on the information surrounding avoiding ibuprofen. I\\'m getting questions from patients and the only reputable mention of it I\\'ve found is in this Lancet article, which only briefly mentions it in the setting of potentially increasing ACE2: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltextI\\'m hesitant to base recommendations on laboratory studies but ....? Toradol hasn’t been shown to be a great antipyretic After briefly getting tests back in 3 days, we\\'re back out to 5+ days and we\\'ve been told to cut access to testing to only health care workers and people in the hospital. Sounds like there\\'s a shortage on reagents to me reading between the lines of some things said to me. You\\'re being downvoted, but you are technically correct.This is the quote from above&gt;  the UK has shutdown yesterday.The technically correct quote should be&gt; the UK has start to shutdown yesterday Assuming country x somehow prevent infection spread completely. As most ppl stays at home with limited contact to others for more than 14 days ( while 80% of the infected develop Immunity and 20% are treated ).Won\\'t that stop the spread till a case is imported or infection reemerge, repeating the same circle.Just to be clear I\\'m not criticizing any measures taken to minimize the death toll. Hmm, no. Looks like they are afraid it might cause too much fear. &amp;#x200B;Anyway, it shows about 40 or so patients in large rooms with only 1 staff in sight. Patients desaturating, patients semi-unconscious on NRB, patients almost falling out of gourneys. It is one of the saddest things I have seen. &amp;#x200B;Anyway point was quality of care appears to have really taken a hit with the staffing issues. A year from now, I think we\\'re going to look back at China and realize they were a special case.Because of China\\'s authoritarian rule, they had the ability (and even the political will-power) to enforce stick lockdowns and ensure this passed relatively quickly.Western countries will not see the same lockdown response. I\\'d personally expect this to pan out for a lot longer time in western countries. Supposedly they can be reused up to 5 times with the limit being obvious contamination (wet with moisture from ones own breath or body fluid splash), which ever comes first.With the supply chain issues I guess there is no alternative And special needs students who not only aren\\'t getting school but aren\\'t getting PT, OT, or speech therapist. I have a 3 year old in school who has been doing phenomenally since she started and I\\'m worried that all of her gains will be lost. We can afford to bring people into our house to do it privately for a little while but I\\'m not even sure that\\'s a good idea. Slow down the system. Stop new infections Has there been any case report of COVID-19 in HIV patients ?I think it may Provide insight on the role of immune response and the cytokine storm theory. Let’s put it this way, as a general rule people and animals will develop immunity to a virus after being infected with it. This is how most viruses work, in particular it’s also how most coronaviruses work. There really is no evidence that this virus is an exception to that rule, and if it was then it would make this virus exceptionally unique. A few anecdotal reports that could easily be explained by a flare up or prolonged infection shouldn’t cause us to toss everything we know about viruses out the window. The bigger concern is that there is some evidence of people being contagious after symptoms have subsided. I am far more worried about people who had the virus spreading it to others after their symptoms are gone than the possibility of this virus being an enigma that causes reinfection. Slow it so the system can handle it. China almost certainly hasn\\'t eliminated it. Word I\\'m not sure if my question make sense, When a country shut down, is their goal to slow down the infection to a spread the health system can accommodate. Or are they aiming for China, elimination of the infection till a vaccine is made ? Based on the fact that almost every virus works like that and there really is no evidence that this virus is an exception. Shot by someone who didn\\'t? Good bot Is nonfunctional ppe even considered ppe at that point? Why the devil would you shave... what madness was this? So far the hospital has burned through over 70% of this years entire supply of masks in the last two weeks but we only have one confirmed case and two possibles that are still awaiting testing. My OR has decided to hoard all the N95 masks they could find or acquire, while also punishing people for wearing them while in the OR and attempting to prevent other units from stealing equipment. Anesthesia isn’t very happy with this as they aren’t comfortable working with patients doing even non aerosol generating procedures with the current level of equipment available. It’s business as usual until we get a local outbreak event but there’s a soft limit to adding non-emergent cases. Also several people have come back from cruises and or trips over the weekend but were tested. One of our people who was working cases was tested on the cruise and shown negative but is back to work with what appears to be “allergies”.  Another who recently returned from Seattle was hanging out in the lounge even though they were off and was also displaying some “allergy” like symptoms. Preop is doing patient screening and visitor limits. Honestly I feel like we’re fucked because nobody is taking any of this seriously, the vast majority of my coworkers have either completely ignored what’s going on as propaganda or just downplayed this as another flu. I get we tend to have blinders on because draining fingers and C-sections are more important but I’m not very confident with how we are approaching things. Considering we live in a fairly large city with a large population of elderly or those considered at risk, when it does kick off we’re going to get slammed. Unfortunately that isn’t an option &gt;  I think you do get immune to itBased on what facts are you saying this? I\\'m not arguing with you, but I\\'m reading so much anecdotal data... That\\'s not really helping. I\\'m not an expert but there are very few reports of reinfection, most of them seem to be anecdotal or a result of inaccurate testing before. I believe in herd immunity. Makes more sense than in China, where they\\'re just gonna get rid of quarantines just for everyone to get re-infected No! The whole point of this post is to *minimize* exposure! In the US &gt; I assume la Repubblica is a reliable news source? Yeah, no reason to think this would be faked by the paper/journalist. Hopefully there\\'ll be real analysis on this soon. Thank you. I fully understand all of the above already. I was merely clarifying for the sake of avoiding misinformation that the uk has not shut down yesterday, as stated before. Thank you for all of your information regardless. Like I said, the process has started and is being phased in over the next days/week. So far they have removed emergency personnel from large gatherings, which makes them impossible to insure and therefore impossible to hold. Recommendations on social distancing have been implemented. Right now attending restaurants, clubs, shopping centres is not recommended but not enforced - they want people to comply willingly. But once the UK\\'s caseload reaches the appropriate number, compliance will be enforced. I said the UK hasn’t been shut down yesterday, because it hasn’t. Restaurants, clubs, schools, transport, shopping centres and everything still open. I don’t understand how this constitutes shutting down. Do you know of another source for this video, it\\'s blocked now Yes it has. We were initially following a mitigation strategy, but following a recent report from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College London we\\'ve switched to a suppression strategy (i.e. close it all down). That\\'s not happening instantly, it\\'s being phased in over days. I know that in the hospital I work at (CA) the adult side has run out of swabs and we\\'re dangerously low on reagent. Not that we have any test kits anyways so the swabs were sent to Quest and are just sitting there... If test numbers are being obscured with for that reason, do you think retroactively accurate numbers are likely to emerge once the economy has stabilized?  Or never? No it hasn’t?? first step will be 24h and then continue for a regular shift - so 32h. but i expect to go back to weekend shifts, i.e. 48h, our *regular* workload means i usually get to sleep 4-6h/shift. Yes but I\\'m still unclear, is there an emergency during a pandemic? Can anyone point me to some references regarding immunity after COVID-19? My country has decided to go with the group immunity strategy and frankly I feel a bit anxious; I was under the impression it is not clear at all how immunity works with this virus? The UK has walked back the \"herd immunity\" thing - claiming it was misinterpreted by the media. In any case, the UK has shutdown yesterday. I want so much to direct some nursing colleagues here. I’m afraid, based on their social media, that they would “brigade.” I cause enough trouble without calling in the “it’s just a flu” nurses. Stand by it! My stupid ass sister has  been partying it up in NOLA. I won’t see her until his is ALL over. She can’t be trusted. Period. Symptoms of viral infections(not all) are due to body\\'s immunological response. Glucocorticoids are used in treatment of symptoms of viral infections, f.ex. hemorrhaging fevers. Children have a weaker immune system then adults and they not affected.So in theory to temporarily moderate immunological response in severely affected patients could mild but prolong the symptoms. Any professionals have an analysis about what is going on in Japan? It seems like we are running the same “herd immunity” strategy as the UK. I know this may be their strategy to flatten the curve in hopes the Olympics start on schedule but it’s causing people to get restless and ready to get back to normal since the daily numbers are so low. Testing though is low it seems. If I ever build a house I’ll have an attached garage with a laundry room with a shower stall between the house and garage. Or a shower in the garage. Watch these become HGTV features. They’ll call them “Physician Passthroughs” or something. This is not a bad idea. Broken hips and hot spots out to sea. Plus, aren’t there supplies in these ships that could be used? Surely they’re not using “just in time” inventorying. Drop Kick Murphy is live streaming their audience free St Pats show. Please encourage everyone to stay home and watch that ALONE. Your coworkers should be ashamed. And publicly shamed. Ive seen too many nurses saying really stupid shit! Including four nurses and a nursing student that stayed in NOLA until the cops came around to close up shop! It’s gonna be real bad real soon. Also important to note, as the UK report states, China\\'s draconian measures only work so long as they are enforced. As soon as the restrictions are lifted, the virus will resume it\\'s growth.Wuhan will have slightly lower transmission rates since some now have immunity, but I believe the number of recovered cases is still very low relative to the city\\'s population, so it likely won\\'t have much of an effect. There are laws to report whistleblowers. I am not familiar enough to say if they protect you for going to the media or just to a regulatory body. I am not currently working and would be happy to research that for you tomorrow if you drop me a PM with your state. That policy is bullshit, unfortunately Are you a med pro!? Can you get off reddit and contribute to the pandemic plz? &amp;#x200B;The detachment is unreal. There are already 2 US ER docs in critical care. Well get updated numbers tomorrow. That’s been the pattern in IL as far as I can tell. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent&gt; The department of health said there was currently significant pressure on stocks of all consumables used by laboratories.But it voiced particular concern about RNA extraction.“Due to global demand exceeding supply, stocks of all laboratory related testing consumables are under considerable strain,” a spokeswoman said.“At the moment there are particular concerns around supplies of swabs and DNA extraction kits.”https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-chief-warns-of-supply-pressure-on-reagents-for-coronavirus-tests/573999/&gt; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Wednesday told a House appropriations subcommittee that the agency is “aware of pressure in the supply system on the reagents” needed to run diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus. Specifically, Hahn said “there are pressures particularly around RNA” required for COVID-19 testing. Got me ;-) No parties around anymore due to friggin corona... so I gotta tell Reddit ;-) Stay safe! Removed due to Rule 4 After you had exposure to COVID19 without PPE. Also called quarantine. So... Dont\\' drive faster than Mach 1? ;) Pretty sure if the mask is not your primary protection, you can use anything that is porous to air as a facemask even a tissue paper.  Just be sure to secure tightly so you don\\'t touch your face while in use.  And then follow proper procedure for sanitizing your hands before taking off and disposal. Keep turning those knobs buddy /salute We can only test: people who have been overseas in the last 14 days and have cough or fever; healthcare workers with fever; severe bilateral pneumonia. We are massively under testing. Neither of the two positive cases in my city met testing criteria and both have no idea where they got it. This comment simply doesn’t apply to the situation we’re heading into The stock market is tanking anyways.  It knows whats up.  The US incompetent lack of testing means tracing is a completely useless strategy to mitigate now.  We must assume everyone has it and the sombering study from the UK says that even with maximum measures, the need for ICU\\'s will far exceed our surge capacity by several factors.Here\\'s hoping that chloroquine or one of the other promising drugs is available en mass to mitigate the effects especially the lung fibrosis that\\'s requiring so many infected to be hospitalized. gf-gsw Something you can write on, thought to have originated from Egyptian papyrus I think there are many reagent manufacturers over Europe. I don\\'t know what I would do but by clearing of based on symptoms/clinical examination one does create spreaders sooner or later. Priority 4, give them morph,  get them into the shade and have their mate hold their hand and talk with them. Once you stabilise Pri 3\\'s, go back and check your 4 to try to evac them. The mind is often our worst enemy. This is simplified as best I could. If you’re immunocompromised, your immune system has been suppressed or weakened whether through other preexisting conditions or through drugs like chemotherapy meds. Your body’s white blood cell count ends up lower than normal and you end up being vulnerable to more things whereas a healthy immune system could fight off the majority of things and limit the impact on your body. When you get sick, your body would send WBCs to fight the virus but with a low WBC count and weak immune system, your body cannot effectively fight off the virus, leading to a “worse course” as it infects more cells. It just means they’re at risk for worse outcomes with more moderate/severe symptoms compared to someone who has a healthy immune system. I hope this answers your question! Chicago according to their comment history. LEEEROYYYYYY    JENKINNNNNNNS To everyone working in a medical laboratory: is your lab or country having problems with obtaining reagents for DNA extraction? We (South Korea) recently had to beg Roche to please send more reagents because the PCR testing volume went through the ceiling. I understand this 100% but this is a nationwide problem and completely out of my hands. We are an island. Apparently the test reagent is made in Italy? They’re keeping it for themselves so we’ve been told. Could mushrooms contain the cure to this virus?\"Antiviral compounds isolated from the mushrooms have shown potential activity against prominent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, etc.\" ? C [removed] Agreed. I had ERT (emergency response team) training before, and we learned triage for mass casualty situations. It was a tough lesson, but our goal is to maximize how many people come out of it alive. If someone is near death, you actually declare that person deceased. You do not spend time trying to save that person until after the triage is done. Normally, for non-disaster situations, the goal is to save that one person, buying time for the paramedics to arrive [this video](https://www.cottagehealth.org/covid-19-video/)  has some good info. I believe later on in this presentation it shows the accuracy.  Having a broch is the most accurate followed by sputum..... My city is likely about to get hit hard. I\\'m a little scared, but I\\'m ready as I\\'ll ever be.If I die I\\'m going to haunt all of the CMOs. Engineers and fire signs (Sagittarians, Leos, Aries). I know this comes not really helpful from an academic tertiary center, but fight for tests at every cost. Clincal presentation and symptoms are neither specific nor sensitive. We\\'ve seen positives in asymptomatic contact persons or just a mere sore throat. Majority of inital presentations afebrile. Data is powered by PowerBI, here a link: http://aka.ms/covidreportI don\\'t have ICU numbers for US, [here](https://i.imgur.com/KVoY56R.png) is what I have You\\'re not wrong, and I guess I should\\'ve stated that the patient in my example was just contact precaution, not droplet, airborne, or contact + droplet. If they had coronavirus it would be very different. It\\'s a matter of understanding how the disease that requires them to be isolated is transmitted when making these decisions. The point is that even that event was an emergency if there wasn’t a risk of infection and you weren’t being hit with a pandemic.   In the middle of everything, that is kind of a selfish thing to do...sure you get to feel like you saved that patient (because you obviously did) but at the expense of many others and the safety of yourself and coworkers. RN here. Don’t go back early. Rest. Heal. And love on your new baby. My daughter is 7 months old. I am not doing anything to risk her health. I am not doing anything to risk my health and leave her without a mom. If you get sick you think the hospital will care about you? You think they’ll remember you in a few months? Screw all that. I’ll do my job. If the hospital does not have enough PPE I’m not going in the patients room. I am not risking my life for anyones except my child’s. Is it after they seem to fully revover in some cases? Hit it with a UV sterilizer or ozone machine. &gt; Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China. And so onRemoved under rule 2/3 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. As a universal healer in any game I play, I want to just say its people like you who give me that glimmer of decency and help me continue to play. Thank you friend. Am I dumb or why do people keep saying immunosuppression is a risk for worse course? Does tylenol not have same upregulation of receptor? [removed] As a paramedic, thank you. This is what first contact emergency health workers need to learn to do. Slow down, don, proper PPE prior today Pt contact. Also Doff PPE correctly as well. This post might literally be a lifesaver. Hi there, I am confused why WHO emphasizes much on hands hygiene  than wearing masks for those are equally emphasized in China.Due to the shortage of masks for which should be better used for doctors ?Or because the masks helps little to prevent for the virus yet hands hygiene helps a lot? This question confuses me a lot as I saw few people wearing masks in videos or pictures.I would appreciate so much if anyone could tell me where I can find the answer. Really? I thought they lowered the standards because of low supply when in fact N95 is preferred/recommended. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-15/amid-protective-gear-shortages-healthcare-workers-risk-becoming-part-of-the-problem Maybe reach out to the Department of Health (state or federal) and see if they have needs. Go ahead and collect the recovered case counts from the various public health websites yourself and show me that it’s 7,000. Until then, I’ll go with the agglomeration websites, which by and large have been remarkably consistent. Yeah but they mostly say severe ones like cancer/transplants/heart disease/diabetes etc. I couldn’t see any specifics for autoimmune conditions. It\\'s obscene that people are being expected to deduct isolation time from paid time off. Especially medical professionals. Incredibly disgusting.Not that it\\'s a new problem or anything. But you\\'d think that now of all times... So, an agglomeration site, not a public health organisation of any sort. Yeah, no. Don’t most news sources say that older folks and people with health complications/are immunocompromised are at higher risk? Not only that, but he didn\\'t know that it had happened and immediately asked a random staff member of he did it. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#recovered [deleted] This.

May your family get through this quickly and with good health.  Good luck. Taiwan is right next to China and got 20 currently sick and 47 that got better. Both of your countries did not fire top pandemic staff because they gave mpre than average pushpack from cutting budgets to build a monumentally stupid wall. Donald Trump and his followers needs to own every single, avoidable  bad case of this disease I don\\'t disagree but looking through their history this sub isn\\'t one they typically post in and the comment didn\\'t include anything new so I thought it would be useful to recommend searching the sub before posting as they clearly hadn\\'t seen it discussed here despite it coming up quite often over the past few weeks. I just feel like it’s not taken seriously as if I had a serious illness etc. I’m trying to find anything that states autoimmune conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis) actually put me in a higher risk :( Listen to me. If you are autoimmune and you can self isolate - Do it. Regardless of your profession, you cannot help anyone - in any capacity - if you are infected, on a vent, or dead. You are in the category that is at a statistically higher chance of complications + death. Just my .02 cents thinking too many negative thoughts. alone, imagining healthcare bankruptcy it’ll happen Yea I feel you.  Have my baby sleeping on me now  and I’m  kinda freaked out about what the next several months will be like. It’s a little Is this your first?  I’m glad this is #2 for us because with the first one I had no clue what I was doing (sometimes still feel that way).Good luck to you both. Seems like the use of N95s is overzealous in both examples.

The Professor of Clinical Immunology of the University of Florence **Sergio Romagnani** writes this at the top of the Tuscany Region, in anticipation of a strong increase in cases also in the Region, on the basis of the study on the inhabitants of [Vo \\'Euganeo](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/24/news/coronavirus_vo_euganeo_no_allo_stop_c_e_da_lavorare_la_lite_nella_chat_del_paese-249409885/) where the 3000 inhabitants of the country are been subjected to swab.  &gt;  &gt;The immunologist explains that the data provided by the study carried out on all the inhabitants of Vo \\'Euganeo highlight two very important information: \"the percentage of infected people, even if asymptomatic, in the population is very high and represents the majority of cases above all, but not only that, among young people; and the isolation of asymptomatics is essential to be able to control the spread of the virus and the severity of the disease \".  &gt;  &gt;For Romagnani, what is now crucial in the battle against the virus is \"trying to flush out asymptomatic people who are already infected because nobody fears or isolates them. This is particularly true for categories such as doctors and nurses who frequently develop an infection. asymptomatic by continuing to spread the infection between them and their patients. \" And again: \"It is being decided not to swab doctors and nurses again unless they develop symptoms. But in light of the results of Vo \\'study, this decision can be extremely dangerous; hospitals risk becoming areas of high prevalence of infected in which no infected is isolated \".  &gt;  &gt;In Vo \\'- Romagnani points out - with the isolation of infected subjects, the total number of patients fell from 88 to 7 (at least 10 times less) within 7-10 days. The isolation of the infected (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) was not only able to protect other people from contagion, but also appeared to protect against the serious evolution of the disease in infected subjects because the cure rate in infected patients, if isolated, was in 60% of cases equal to only 8 days.I assume [la Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/) is a reliable news source?

Is this the temporary firebreak type vaccine? Worrying about what to do about work, I have autoimmune issues and immune health conditions plus allergies and weak immune system on corticosteroids. I will receive full pay to self isolate but I just can’t fathom doing so or that my bosses will be at all happy about this.Just because they aren’t extremely serious health conditions I feel like I’m in a grey area. I can’t really find much info about autoimmune conditions and covid, can anyone point me to some info? It’s the third rule from House of God - in a cardiac code, the first procedure is to take your own pulse. That doesn\\'t track with any reputable reports ice seen so far. Can you provide a source? According to today\\'s WHO situation report, there\\'s a total of 167511 total confirmed cases world wide. Your number would mean that half of all the people that have been confirmed infected have recovered, which simply isn\\'t plausible given the recent hikes in numbers. In most places, tests are only being reported positive/added into the totals once confirmed. I.e. my institution had 2 confirmed inpatient, 8 at home, plus another 50 or so PUIs. State only reports a hundred total cases or so. But there are obviously way more than just my hospital in the state Who issued the restriction? If it came through the executive branch of government, then the police non emergency line. If it came from public health authorities, they should have a telephone number, and will probably take interest in physicians who are ignoring notices. A few months of missed school is mostly just fine. It could be a hassle for kids going into their last year of school and exams, but we can do things like delay exams. Even defer a school year entirely. These are social constructs not fixed in stone.Parent sanity is another thing entirely... but I guess I have to cope. No nation\\'s economy will bounce back from a wave of mass deaths and panic either. Leaders cannot ignore this and hope it will go away. I wish they\\'d see that \"the economy\" exists as part of and for society, it is not an isolated virtual entity that can be considered in isolation from workers/consumers/producers/infrastructure/transport mechanisms as human beings. Better to have a longer period of measured disruption with lots of compensatory and supportive measures like government funded sick leave minimums, limited access small class childcare for critical workers, even temporarily introduce basic income. But no.Social and mental health impacts concern me too. I\\'ve been home with a 6yo and 3yo almost all the time since Friday. 6yo has a cough, probably nothing but better be cautious and protect others. Plus it\\'s our small way to slow the spread and buy time. But OMG it\\'s frustrating. We\\'ll need to start getting out more once eldest is better, doing limited and cautious social contact a bit. Balance risk with sanity and kids mental health too. (layperson peeking out from lurking, hope it\\'s ok deep in the child comments).CPAP was invented for hospital respiratory support before its later deployment in home sleep aponea treatment, right? My son was on CPAP+O2 for a couple of days after a difficult birth.I know CPAP is not a substitute for a proper ventilator. Even bilevel CPAP doesn\\'t deliver negative pressure for forced exhalation, and it\\'s an open system so there\\'s all the risk of spraying potentially infectious droplets everywhere.But I\\'m curious about the extent to which consumer CPAP could be hacked to help, possibly in combination with mechanical exhalation support (bands, etc), outflow filtering, etc. Even basic devices have exhalation pressure relief now and bilevel is much more common.I found the recently posted article on the Las Vegas shootings fascinating (and very sad) too, especially using one ventilator for multiple patients by multiplying volume and using Y tubing. Crazy but awesome.I have two MD friends (both ex-ER, one ex-general-surgeon, both now GPs) who have been expressing frustration at the lack of visibility of any efforts being made to plan for these sorts of \"better than nothing\" emergency measures. They don\\'t Reddit so I figured I would ask. I strongly advocate for all facial hair. Anyone who worked with that nurse needs to be quarantined.  Else congratulations on starting a new cluster.

I’m just replying so I can copy paste and share this. I also work in healthcare. It’s important everyone stay safe. Our staff is invaluable. Saw a comment here from a PA about a nurse hoarding N95 to swab a patient. PA wanted an n95, nurse shrugged them off. PA got pissed, went to find charge nurse and nurse suddenly \\'\\'found\\'\\' the box in the drawer. I think the bigger issue there was the hoarding, but the provider wanted an n95 for swabbing.&amp;#x200B;Currently a new thread about patient treatment prior to result of swab.

People see only 20 or so cases in our decently sized city and think nbd, but I can’t imagine we have fewer than hundreds to thousands of cases at this point. Is there any significant differences between N95 for HCW and N95 for other work? still always good to bring it up again as new information has been cropping up daily.that being said, it’s being used but still experimental and i am eager for more information as well. \"Hey everybody, I\\'m a Redditor who has no experience at all with medical care, but I think I know more than a professional so I will try and shit on them for karma.\"in before the edit:\"edit:   Guys, why the downvotes?

Are you saying it will filter a virus? &gt; Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now.There have been radiologists that work remotely and have hospitals outsource to them for years. Can anyone who’s been seeing cases of COVID-19 give a more detailed description of signs and symptoms?  Specifically I’m interested in the appearance of the oropharynx. Is it very erythematous? Papular erythema? Tonsillitis? Petechiae? I’m a GP working in Australia where we’re rapidly running out of test kits and we’re very restricted on who we can test. When there was an Ebola outbreak and the volunteer doctors sometimes got infected I thought, \"How does Ebola get through their hazmat suits?\"  Then I learned that the dangerous time was when doctors took that stuff off after a long shift - they\\'ve been working long hours in the African heat, they\\'re thirsty, they need the toilet, their faces are dripping sweat and they can\\'t wipe them... If the outside of the Hazmat suit wasn\\'t properly disinfected with a spray, the doctor could easily come into contact with all the infectious fluids on the outside of the suit which had come from their patients (and as Ebola causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding, there could be a lot of these). Not making sure the outside of the suits was thoroughly disinfected was a matter of life and death for these doctors. I have profound admiration for all of the healthcare workers who volunteered their services to work in such unpleasant and distressing circumstances, to try to stop it spreading any further. Don\\'t understand why people are saying a year+ disruption to life.China got their outbreak under control almost completely in a month and a half. They now have a manageable influx of cases that can likely be controlled with good surveillance and precaution among healthcare professionals. Life will largely be able to go back to normal in Wuhan soon.There\\'s a false dichotomy here. People will not be able to go back to life where we weren\\'t taking basic COVID precautions like staying home if you were sick, washing your hands, etc., until a vaccine is available, but social distancing CAN more or less end if we commit HARD, right now, before the spread is overwhelming. Dithering at this moment commits us to \"let\\'s get it over with\" and hundreds of thousands - millions of dead. Yet our hospital just changed their quarantine policy to only quarantine if you are symptomatic and no longer quarantine for suspected exposure. What a bunch of clowns. This is my understanding.  What were the qualms expressed in the comments? I think virus negative on PCR I love you. Thank you for your sanity, patience, and effort. It’s very helpful. I’m an old retired person who used to have a medical license, but I am the resource person for maybe 100 real (not virtual) people. Would you post your link to animal rescue again? People can be asymptomatic and be shedding large amounts of the virus. All patients with suspected contact with the virus should be tested and self isolated as per the WHO since current screening is ineffective. However, with the testing issues in the US, this may not be feasible. Ugh. Rest in peace, doctor Xia. Probably change in case counts over a few days. When the increase in cases starts to go down, it\\'s getting under control. Nurse here:What are the recommended precautions for these patients?I was under the impression it\\'s droplet + eye/hair protection. Airborne precautions in case of aerosolizing procedures (intubation, bronchoscopy). It is also my understanding that after the procedure they are back to droplet.&amp;#x200B;Is this true?Ive seen two posts/comments with complaints about PPE even though the PPE listed seemed appropriate I’m still trying to figure out how the self quarantined person ended up with a gsw. Where are you? My hypothesis is keeping the economy from collapsing.&amp;#x200B;Any worse news and stocks will dive another 10+%. Emotional times in the market. There\\'s about 80,000 recovered individuals right now. If you get sent to isolation today, who will pop that in tomorrow?That\\'s the point. You being healthy and uninfected will contribute to saving many many more people than you saving 1 infected person today and then being stuck at home for weeks.It\\'s not business as usual, it\\'s a pandemic. You\\'re going to lose people and it\\'s going to fucking suck. But society can\\'t afford to lose you and your expertise. Who do we report them to? I know for a fact that my hospital had more positive tests today than is being reported in the news for the state. I don\\'t really know what the disconnect is. It is found in feces, respiratory secretions and blood per [this report](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-covid-19-may-spread-several-different-ways). &amp;#x200B;There\\'s even evidence to suggest a fecal oral transmission. Icu Rn here. I feel absolute gross having to reuse my n95 Thanks This has been covered extensively for weeks, search the subreddit if you want more information.https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fbfj0r/covid19_prophylaxis_in_healthcare_workers/ Yeah, especially the Facebook post doesn\\'t sound remotely close to what I\\'d consider mild. Milder than a bad case of the flu, maybe, but that\\'s a maybe. I am debating going against the policy they set via email which is, essentially, “work unless you’re displaying symptoms.” I think any of us who came into contact with this nurse should self isolate but that would be a lot of people so I can see why they don’t want that. I agree. The clinic recently instituted a policy of essentially “work unless you have symptoms of COVID” which, given the literature, doesn’t sit right with me. Yeah, we have plenty of droplet precaution masks and gloves in clinic, but not enough N95s and to be used in highly suspicious cases of covid only. I\\'ve been told we have goggles, just don\\'t know where. Definitely makes me nervous because we\\'ll probably start having Healthcare workers get sick as we get more cases, and that will create a much more difficult situation. Same goes for us in funeral service. Oh my bad. Please report them if you can. Same thing happened to me. Had to fight tooth and nail with my family to get them to stay put. Was successful but saw a lot of friends who I had personally talked to going out to bars. Lost a lot of respect for some folks, don\\'t know if I can ever look at them the same again. Rule 2 Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. You’re the exact person this is meant for.....smh Good Evening,I had a thought after watching these two videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7F1cnWup9M&amp;t=2s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE4_LsftNKM&amp;t=4sIt seems like hydroxychloroquine is being used in China, South Korea and now Australia (where they are calling it a cure) to treat COVID-19. As a pretty common drug its widely available, and it seems that it would be good to take as a preventive treatment for COVID-19 for first responders and healthcare workers who might be exposed to a high viral load by the nature of their job, and, if the reports out of China, South Korea and Australia are right, it might mean a much more mild course of illness for first responders and healthcare workers who contract the illness. Its wide availability and low side effects in most people seem like its worth the risk, if it does work as suggested.What do you all think? I\\'m in a similar position as an RN with a 5 week old (that was 5 weeks premature and spent 3 weeks in the nicu). If they need me back early I\\'m going to go back most likely. My husband is not happy but we need my income and it\\'s just part of the job. It\\'s not an easy decision with a newborn. If I\\'m dead but I\\'m #1 in dps that\\'s a win in my book. Thread I had with an Infectious Disease doctor on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ffulwq/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_9th_2020/fk12m2l/?context=10000 &gt; Slow is smooth and smooth is ~~quick~~ fast.But yes, absolutely. One of my favorites. What is PAPR (insert PnR meme)? China put a draconian but highly effective quarantine into place. South Korea managed to surge test people, and quarantine any positives efficiently. Without similar measures, it just won\\'t happen. It\\'s very real. Even 100m sprinters are taught to take their time. Don\\'t rush it. My postop lung transplx patient coughed her T-piece off and desatted to 80% in a few seconds. I ran in and popped it on and it was a full minute before her o2 sats stabilized. You\\'re totally right, we should be careful what determines an emergency, but in the ICU it is very situational. These patients are on and off all kinds of support, and they lack any reservoir. A single bad event can be critical to their stability in some of these sickest of pts. Generally speaking, you\\'re right. Most events dont require true urgency. But there are places and times where we need to move. That\\'s what happens when your healthcare system gets overrun. Patients that might make it with intensive care die, because you don\\'t have the intensive care capacity for the number of cases. [removed] Exactly.  The way your outbreak was discovered was mind blowing to me.  A researcher who went against the government to test for covid in her flu study discovers community spread...WTF.  Supposedly, we have such a critical shortage of masks and other protective equipment in CO that they’re going to shut down testing unless they figure out how to get more.  Geniuses. I’m not sure on if they can force her or not. It’s kind of a moot point with my wife. She isn’t going to say no if they ask her to come back early.  She  is close with everyone there and her being gone means everyone else has to work even harder. We are lucky because we will be able to get help from family and I have a very flexible job. Layperson here.  I have zero connection to healthcare, aside from being a patient more often than I\\'d like.  I\\'ve been reading these threads on r/medicine for the last 3-4 weeks; it\\'s my primary source of information, and I feel like it\\'s helped me stay ahead of this thing and take proper actions for myself.  I try to pass pieces of it along to those I care about. I have a 65y/o mother with diabetes, hypertension, and on long-term immunotherapy for CLL who refuses to stay home.  Given the PPE shortages and inexcusable failures of our government at all levels to establish ANY kind of plan to mitigate disaster, I also come here for sobering reminders in cold clinical language that affirm my outwardly healthy, vibrant, awesome mom is likely going to die a totally preventable death that I could see from a mile away and was entirely powerless to stop. I love you, medical professionals.  I hate you, healthcare system.  I respect you, science. Business people should also then understand that forcing staff to work without PPE exposes them to being sued for negligence and workers compensation claims.  Not to mention whistle blowers going to the media, in the current climate how do you think a hospital forcing people to work without PPE is going to go with the public? I find this so confusing because the virus seems to have tapered off somewhat quickly in China and South Korea. Should I shave my beard? [deleted] The situation in Italy is bad. &amp;#x200B;Check out the video. Patients unmonitored. Some gorked needing tubed. Mortality not surprising. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\\\_continue=1&amp;v=U6yeSQr1VGk&amp;feature=emb\\\\_title&amp;fbclid=IwAR2\\\\_RW4RD8IYdwvP31hnOjmUCXbtG5e0ux66taAlHOT41SOjgYeVm\\\\_MKfGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=U6yeSQr1VGk&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;fbclid=IwAR2_RW4RD8IYdwvP31hnOjmUCXbtG5e0ux66taAlHOT41SOjgYeVm_MKfGk) If you have confirmed direct contact with a COVID positive patient, you should not see patients.  You are contagious prior to symptom onset. Avg symptom onset is 5-7 days from exposure but can be up to 14 days. Not having symptoms is not reliable indicator. Non-urban, Wisconsin (so some people are probably wayyyyy out of the loop here). Treat non-covid pt\\'s on the boat.  Leave hospitals for the infected. I was so heartened by this effort before I read the page and realized they don’t know what a ventilator is. 14 day self quarantine until enough tests become available. Inability to test is absolutely handcuffing care. That is so tough. I couldn’t imagine having to go back to work so soon after having a baby. Especially to a to that kind of work during this time. Assuming she used FMLA, can they force her to go back before 12 weeks? I love these. I feel like I\\'m a time traveler from the future who has discovered your diary. Please keep going! Can someone comment on how accurate our PCRs are? Should I trust a negative? or is each lab a little different? It doesn\\'t matter. The US apparently only had 1% of the N95 masks on-hand required for an event like this. The hoarders are annoying, but they aren\\'t the problem. Poor planning is. No the phrase is in english, not korean, so dedpite bad grammar i kept it I would talk to your supervisor and explain that you have what you think is close exposure and ask what to do. They might want you to get tested? But that would mean you would have to have access to tests and be out until the results come back. Clearly they have WAY more infections that they don\\'t know about.But the number of deaths and ICU cases for a country that size is terrifying. I would be wearing a properly fitting N95 respirator and gloves at a minimum. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching anything like your phone, keys and wallet. Be very aware of what you touch with your hands and use alcohol wipes on your personal items. Stay safe. Right. Translated instead of interpreted to make it sound mystical. And what about steroid allergy nose sprays like fluticasone? I didnt cuz its not a proverb. Its the catch phrase of koreans jr drs association. They found no virus in blood, urine, or feces (other than viral rna).  I’d love to know if it’s in breast milk. [deleted] In the POTUS &amp; Co address today, they mentioned they\\'re working in the upcoming bill to allow N95 masks/cartridges to be supplied by companies who supplied N95 masks to industry (I\\'m assuming this is mostly opening up product lines). Their claim is this would open up a significant amount of domestic production capacity for hospital use. I took this being there is a lot of production capacity for OSHA approved N95 masks which aren\\'t certified for health care use. Check this team out! They\\'re looking at 3D printing ventilators. [Project Open Air](https://www.projectopenair.org/) Thank you. I love the way the data is displayed-is there a link to access these graphs daily?Also, is there a way to view ICU bed usage within the US? That would tell us how close we are to crashing into the iceberg in the States.. Think about the logistics - you\\'d have to cram a bunch of possibly contagious people on a boat to get them to the ship in the first place, then you\\'d be shipping them to a box crammed with people. I\\'ve never served on one, but those boats are probably better suited for disaster relief than contagion. Fair enough, thanks! That\\'s basically where I\\'m at as well. absolutely I haven’t looked at the primary data and honestly have no business commenting. Thanks for thinking of us. We have, at least, convinced leadership to cancel all live shows and most food service at the casino. Sanitation has been doubled. I just know it won\\'t be enough. I also know where we will all be without casino profits. It\\'s a tough spot to be in. Your prayers have been answered, kind stranger.  We NIPPV\\'d the (figurative) shit out of the toilet.  The ghost of my face has been banished. For now. It’s the nurse who sits next to me who was coughing last week who tested positive. I last saw her on Wednesday and I haven’t taken a test and dont have symptoms. I actually just spent an entire hour talking to my doc about this situation and he\\'s frustrated because the people in power aren\\'t making smart choices. And again, we\\'re in Seattle, and his network\\'s team isn\\'t making smart choices. No, that patient was from the SCJ cult while the salt spraying church is nominally mainstream. Well mainstream by Korean standards given that they performed faith healing and were doing so on the day of the salt spraying. Nearly 8% mortality?

Seems a little overly antagonistic now given that my main use of reddit is moderating but, well... sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes he eats you.I would jump at temporary housing. I am slightly worried for my own health but would be devastated if I brought something dangerous home to my family. Was it you or the other nurse who tested positive. Hipster vegans Thanks for the update, I’ve been wondering how different Tribes have been preparing for this. I really hope that you’re able to convince tribal leadership, it sounds like everyone is in a really difficult spot. I haven\\'t been on social in several days because I\\'ve spent every waking hour trying to convince my tribal leadership to take this seriously. No one outside of health care is listening to me because they don\\'t want to close the casino. THIS IS NOT GREED- our tribe is not part of IHS and gaming funds our health care (and everything else). The bill before congress only expands Medicaid and IHS funding. We are on our own. I am exhausted and we haven\\'t even been hit yet.  Though, if we were testing I know of several cases that would likely be positive. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. Plungers are like BIPAP. The key is getting a good seal. Oh good, we\\'re running out of surgical masks (and we have 0 confirmed cases, and are doing extraordinarily few tests) so we\\'re expected to reuse those/put them in a bag. I raised the same point as above - any particles on the outside will get on the inside - and was then told it only applies to the nurses (I\\'m a resident). I was like...that\\'s not any better, the same is still true for them, but haven\\'t gotten a response yet. Unfortunately, that\\'s a totally different skill and equipment set than what we\\'re set up for (capital equipment like ventilators, etc) :( Not just economic. Think about all of the children who aren\\'t in school learning. Also the emotional/psychological toll of extreme social distancing. Ours are being canceled starting tomorrow. True, someone recently characterized a mild COVID19 case as \"the worst cold you will ever have in your life and live through it.\"Having had bacterial pneumonia before and currently working with COVID19 patients, I hope I will be one of those asymptomatic cases, since the bacterial pneumonia experience was already bad enough. Right, that\\'s what I\\'m saying it\\'s not \\'mild symptoms\\' that\\'s pretty severe. It\\'s super shitty. At the end of the day, protect your family. Get your wife to ensure that her employer has facilities for them to wash coming to &amp; from work. Your wife should ALWAYS ensure that she wears her PPE. Also when leaving for the day she should change her clothes and wash thoroughly. Put the clothes into a plastic bag and either leave them sealed outside or wash them immediately upon returning home. Do what you can to protect yourself. And even more importantly, do everyhting in your power to protect the residents of her home. You guys need to practice social isolation more than anyone. If there\\'s a single case in that LTC facility, there\\'s a high likelihood of multiple fatalities. It\\'s an hypothesis at this point AFAICT:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext So no ketorolac either in your opinion? The direct care nurse gave me shift report too. She wasn\\'t wearing PPE for duration of care because she had no reason to. Management should have sent her home immediately but we are short staffed already. People arent taking it seriously enough.... Does anyone have any knowledge about ACE2 upregulation with any NSAID\\'s besides ibuprofen? I\\'m specifically looking at ketorolac. It would be nice to have a non-opioid for muscle/joint pain that isn\\'t going to increase susceptibility to infection by COVID (if that in fact happens with ibuprofen at all, which is just a hypothesis for now). I don\\'t have much time to do a deep dive at the moment, so anything would help.This is referring to the Lancet article linked below:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext I’ve been posting all over worried about my fathers PPE but now a nurse that I sit next to had a bad cough last week. She tested positive for the virus over the weekend. They want me to come in anyway since no symptoms but I feel very concerned after seeing reports of transmission pre-symptoms. I do not want to transfer this to my patients who are primarily acute and elderly. Should I stay home? I am thinking primarily of this article that was shared here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1Does the evidence seem compelling enough to people that I should self isolate or would PPE be enough to abate most concerns of accidentally infecting those I come into contact with?FWIW I’m at an outpatient clinic this week. They showed a study on that at last week\\'s grand rounds.  From SARs-1, but surgical masks were non inferior.  Still, for aerosol inducing procedures (bronch, intubation), I\\'d definitely want an N95 Unfortunately we’re one of the bigger pediatric hospitals in the US. I’m too afraid to lose my job otherwise I would. to be fair, pneumonia does that to you. Even if you dont have ARDS, the weakness will be with you for some time. Slow is smooth and smooth is quick. I figured it would be old news, I just had to check. Are you in a major city? Have you thought about going to local news, as well? If the news reports that local hospitals are not equipped, I (hope) more people will take their quarantines seriously and it might lessen the load 10-12 days from now. Q: How can you tell if there\\'s a jet pilot at a party?A: Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll tell you. Can I rephrase then?Are we close to having an antibody test? Because I’m wondering if, given the very low reinfection rates, once healthcare workers (such as myself) get COVID-19 can we test for/establish immunity? Maybe rent a furnished studio for her? Will be cheaper than a hotel at least What’s the best case scenario? You feel better for a few hours but follow the same general disease trajectory.What’s the worst case? You increase viral uptake and have a more severe disease course.I’ll stick with Tylenol, thanks. Plus..... you guys need tanks at the ready... You know just in case. Our hospital systems’ leadership cancelled elective surgeries today (our state coronavirus rate was at 26 at the time of the announcement), which surprised and impressed me. Also. Plowing money into buying ventilators and equipment is not going to magically train the army of specialists required to use them. Hell even the cleaning staff are specially trained in our intensive care ward. We\\'ve been told we may have to improvise masks out of vaccine bags. This situation really has shown up massive shortcomings in both funding and the planning. There\\'s for sure a lot of variables here that are very hard to predict. I hope your government would step in with some kind of social safety net in that case, I doubt that scenario would happen here in Sweden. thats insane man :( Are they considering that if we keep everything shut down like this for more than a month or so, a bunch of lower income service workers are going to be out on the streets, since they won\\'t be able to make rent? Social distancing isn\\'t going to happen in the homeless camps and breadlines that spring up. I do worry that if we do too much social distancing, it\\'s going to bite us in the ass. Hospitals are already reusing disposable N95\\'s...so...reusable is actually a plus here. Just showed up to work today. An elective surgical patient with bilat pnuemonia exposed ~25 healthcare workers and is being tested for it now.  Essentially an entire floor of staff along with Anesthesia and RT. I don\\'t understand why elective surgeries aren\\'t being canceled. Ours is having us wear a surgical mask over the N95 to keep droplets from contaminating the front of the mask, so it can be more safely reused. Luckily we aren\\'t running out of surgical masks yet. I saw posts on one of these mega threads about HCW avoiding exposing their family. The general consensus was HCW should wear scrubs that the hospital launders, or have a designated \"dirty\" room at home. When you get home, you strip in the \"dirty\" room, wash your clothes and take a shower before coming into contact with the rest of the family.It\\'s not...great. But it\\'s better than nothing? You can also tip it to propublica: https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/we-want-to-talk-to-people-working-or-living-on-the-front-lines-of-coronavirus-help-us-report We were told not to come in. If we were sick enough to wear a mask at work we\\'d be sent home. Occurrences for call outs and needing to burn through your pto (fuck you if you\\'re low on that for any reason) to take this time off still apply. Maybe they are symptoms of zinc supplementation catching on? Today situation in Italy[link Italy 3/16](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vhulmcbii5rnao/Microsoft%20Power%20BI.pdf?dl=0) Yellow - ICURed - DeathsOrange - RecoveredPlease spread the message to stay at home; it is for our safety. Do it before it becomes bad as it is here in Italy right now PGY2 Neurosurgery Resident I second mask and other standard PPE. Our hospital is low on N95\\'s and has no Papr hoods, for those who need them. If you can\\'t get the raw materials needed for those, even simple stuff like surgical masks, gowns, and gloves are in limited supplies. I know it\\'s not necessarily the most exciting engineering challenge, but it\\'s really what\\'s needed. PPE, vents need people to operate them This is what truly sucks for our situation. We have one bathroom and no garage, wife is an NP caring for an entire LTC home of 100+ patients. I can\\'t think of any way to maintain good protection for me and the kids in this situation. We\\'ve been talking about putting her up in a hotel but how the hell can we afford that for months? Your fist job is to fly that damn plane, your second job is to navigate it around safely (cause you can\\'t navigate anywhere if you\\'re a ground dart), your third job is to communicate. No one cares if you managed to follow proper protocols with ATC if your plane dug a hole. Did you see this hackathon for creating an open-source ventilator? Some interesting comments at the bottom too [https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/](https://hackaday.com/2020/03/12/ultimate-medical-hackathon-how-fast-can-we-design-and-deploy-an-open-source-ventilator/) I believe so. I cannot find the article but they believe most providers who get sick do so by infecting themselves accidentally while donning/doffing PPE Wow, what state are you in? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5.pdf Totally agree.  At the very least, temporary housing for exposed staff should be made available so that healthcare workers have the option to isolate themselves if they feel it necessary.  Maybe the stockpiles don’t exist. That could be.  Then maybe we need to consider dedicating facilities to Covid 19 patients.  Rapid 4 hour testing prior to admission would make this possible in large urban communities.There are so many ways this terrible situation could be addressed without throwing millions of healthcare workers into a gunfight to do battle with butter knives. They are aware. Revenue seems to be more important at this point. It’s sad. &gt;With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.For what\\'s it\\'s worth, I\\'ve seen some evidence that surgical masks are just about as effective as N95 masks for protection. N95 masks have been recommended because they\\'re known to filter particles as small as SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and preliminary reports of of China indicated that the virus *might* be able to aerosolize and be inhaled without filtration. However, since then, true widespread airborne transmission hasn\\'t really been confirmed, and the consensus now seems to be that it mostly or only travels through respiratory droplets. *Surgical masks protect against droplets just as well as N95s*. It may be more reasonable to use home health services for other non-COVID cases as the respiratory compensation requiring intubation seems to be rather rapid. I agree that it needs to happen now - and that is why I explained how it will happen and when it will happen. The hospitals with higher levels of emergency preparedness are really shining right now and I feel horrible for everyone else. You shouldn\\'t be in this position. Someone shared this with me here yesterday, [head of dept of anesthesia and ICU in a research hospital in Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKS1pahoPRU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=412) talking about his experience right now. They cancelled elective surgeries and had to increase capacity significantly to handle the surge. It sounds like they were extremely well-equipped to handle the situation, and it still continues to be difficult for them every day. Consider sharing it with your superiors or coworkers. I assume Italy\\'s recommendations should not be taken lightly. He is such a fucking bastard. Removed under Rule 2: No personal health situations. it\\'s respiratory.  PPE more important.  Should wash hands too [BBC also just reported that Alibaba co-founder is shipping supplies to us.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51904379) Unfortunately, much of this is not being reported in local news, maybe to limit panic? ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ It would lose  (⌐■_■) the element of supplies Maybe masks and other PPE? “No you’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”“All right then.”Favorite movie of all time. I empathize with your situation.  We’re sleeping in separate beds also.  At the very least, if hospitals are not providing proper PPE they should make temporary housing available for staff do they can reduce the chance of transmitting to their community.  This is what happened in China, correct?At a certain point, it does become a question of ethics, and I can see where you are coming from. At the same time, critical care RNs exposed to infectious patients for hours on end without proper PPE strikes me as dumb, counterproductive, and ethically wrong.   I’m the asshole in this ethical situation, and I know the subtext is that people don’t get care.  And yet if we look at italy, that’s the exact situation their healthcare providers are in.  So I don’t know what the answer is, except the situation is incredibly disturbing and I think we need to vocalize it so that the public is aware of what is happening. I totally agree that PPE should be made available to staff. Staff should be protected as well as be able to reduce spread between patients. It seems fucking obvious to me that cost should not be a factor, and if stockpiles exist, they should be distributed as required. My understanding is that, in many cases, there actually aren\\'t stockpiles, and that ordering through the usual pathways is not helpful. What we shouldn\\'t do is just abandon people in their hour of greatest need and close hospitals. Safest bet, if you have a mild to moderate case just take paracetamol(acetaminofen) to control your temperature. Beardless, Day 8  My other beared compatriot has also shaved now, but he went with a mustache. My jealous is palpable.  CostCo is out of toilet paper and baby wipes. I really just wanted carrots, so I\\'m good.  The promised plunger has arrived. Battle to commence. This is good stuff. Probably unrelated but reminds me of my work as airline pilot: We never rush, take our time. If not available, we make time. ESPECIALLY when shit hits the fan. My local hardware store still has a few half face respirators and filter kits available - P100. They are much more expensive ($40 for the respirator plus $20 per filter kit), but  being overlooked.Obviously, actually being able to use in the work place is a different story.---EDIT: I should clarify, this late Saturday night. Madness may have hit in the last day and changed this. As of late Saturday, masks where nearly wiped out but still a few respirators available.

Lessons from China about proper PPE from Xihong Lin, a professor at the Harvard Department of Biostatistics (see slides 55-56).  The protocol in China is a protective suit, medical goggles, cap, face shield, mask, and gloves when seeing suspected COVID cases.  Using this level of protection, none of the 42,000 external doctors and nurses sent to Wuhan was infected, though some of the internal doctors were, before adequate PPE was used.https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tGJF9tdv4osPhY1-fswLcSlWZJ9zx45/edit I remember reading about mRNA vaccines a few years ago in an immunology text book, it was a relatively recent book, but they made it sound like these were a long way away.  I guess this is as good an opportunity as any to give it a try as we are in dire need of a vaccine and not having to wait for incubation would be huge.  Don\\'t believe there are any other mRNA vaccines on the market. I\\'m not sure where you are but it hasn\\'t hit us hard here in Canada yet. My girlfriend is also an ICU nurse.

[deleted] Dunno.Found this if interestedhttps://sci-hub.tw/https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243 Our hospital wants us to store our N95 masks in a bag with our name on it and reuse for multiple cycles. Seems counterproductive. If the mask is actually catching particles, aren\\'t we just going to cross contaminate ourselves by putting on and off multiple times? Someone gold this Australia here, ran out of masks, using Bunnings p2 mask as first line specialist. The world has gone crazy. Odd mechanism. Are there any other vaccines that work through host translation of mRNA? We have an algorithm but it’s... not perfect. Because a huge chunk of what we spend on \"Healthcare\" isn\\'t spent on healthcare. It\\'s spent on administration, like our corrupt insurance \"industry\", hospital billing, chargebacks, medical loans (how insane is that??) etc. any evidence to debunk or verify claim?Whats the official verdict.

(I had two 24h shifts last week and after that I need sleep or I am a danger to my patients) Basically they don’t stockpile enough of this stuff for something like this. They typically order it when they need it and it shows up. Now everyone everywhere needs the same stuff at the same time - globally. Patients will need largely the same interventions provided by a small group of specialized healthcare providers. So we have a supply/demand issue there too. Similarly our hospitals are tailored to meet the demand they normally experience, but add corona virus on top of what has already been a bad flu season and you have a lot of sick people coming through the door.This is why it is important to flatten the curve. We can’t stop the virus but we can slow down the growth rate so that our healthcare system doesn’t get overwhelmed as badly. The good news is that the people who are in our healthcare system - every tech, nurse, pa, and doctor I know are intelligent, hardworking, and brave people. They are working hard to get prepared and they will do their best to help us all through this. Fuck. No way governments will go with that timeline (18 months in paper). They will pick an acceptable mortality over the economic hit that would cause. person\\\\* not just american First rule of Heavy Weapons Guy: protect the medic.

Kaiser Permanente Washington Vaccine trial: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04283461?term=mrna-1273&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 Yesterday I had to order an emerg CT on a SDH which my attending needed to decide on whether to operate as an emergency at night or the next day. It took 6h to get it because they have to clean out the CTs after every suspected covid. And my attending made me call and ask to please hurry with it two times (I apologized obv). And this is only the start, one CT is already designated only covids. We have no face shields, N-95, or PAPR on the unit we designated our COVID unit. They are only with the house supervisor at all times. I can only hope it changes but I don’t know it it will. Our pharmacist is vital to the RRT/code team. I just grabbed the code box of meds and told mine to stay out because of lack of equipment. It’s hard to shout in N-95 and through doors to get their expertise Medical device engineer, here. Say I have a US-based factory and team of engineers available. Is there anything we could be doing to help? We\\'re tossing around ideas like \"Design and build crude emergency ventilators\", but it seems like anything we could do would take too long (even ignoring the regulatory considerations).Are there any needs for equipment that aren\\'t being met? hi, do you have any source on that? (my gf has asthma and I keep trying to find any data on it) Yes, I’m not sure what the timeline on getting the end products...and in the meantime we’re just flying blind in the healthcare system. Whether it’s 16 days or 6 weeks, we’re talking about exponential growth of an infectious disease and we’re in an even worse position than China and Italy because we’re not the only healthcare system in crisis.  I know people don’t want to hear this and that’s why it’s not being reported as it should be.  It scares me just thinking about it. All sketchy data, but it seems to come on late, even after respiratory recovery. Also sketchy reports but in Italy they have supposedly been using echo to decide who to give vents to (avoiding those with newly diminished EF). People are talking about getting back to normal in a few weeks right now on the radio (NPR).I don\\'t know, at some point we are going to have to decide what social distancing to maintain long term and what not to. I don\\'t think we can keep schools closed for 18 months. You are so correct and honestly I’m a dumb ass when it comes to doing anything to help. I blame comics. It was a place I never thought I’d be and feel rattled by it. I absolutely did not risk myself without proper PPE and kicked out those who didn’t. We didn’t even have it on the unit or near this unstable individual. It was also a poor execution of transport. Our policy is to place a blanket of intubated patients and close doors. Our COVID unit is 2 elevators and 3 hallways away from ICU   and probably 1/4 mile total. We are out of PPE in a major midwest urban US hospital. Even surgical masks are under lock and key and are not being distributed outside ER/MICU. Patients still need to be seen in my clinic. We have canceled every appointment we can, and are able to re-route symptomatic patients to a dedicated COVID testing suite so we are lucky in that sense, but I still feel my odds of exposure are 100%. We know the infectious risk peaks right before/at the initiation of symptoms. I don\\'t think I can (or will) ethically refuse to see patients who are very ill and on active treatment. I am thinking of at least starting to sleep on the couch to try to isolate myself from my family. This whole comment chain is a much needed window of fun in a pretty grim time. Thank you.

Feel free to try and use it but don\\'t necessarily expect a swift answer. make a throwaway email and twitter handle whilst using a VPN. No one will know who you are. &gt; I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required.&gt; healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should.With as much as we spend on healthcare in the US, how the hell is it this bad?! One million US deaths in the best case scenario which seems to include 18 months of social distancing? Can you imagine what the world would be like a year from now? I can’t comprehend it. Apparently China forced manufacturers of other goods to start manufacturing PPE and hand sanitizer. A friend mind is from China and her extended family offered to send her a bunch of masks and hand sanitizer. We\\'re in Seattle, so she was like, \"Hmmmm...\" She\\'s MS though so she can work from home, so they\\'re all pretty safe and security. You absolutely have to post before/after pics! We need something lighthearted. I don\\'t see this the same as taking 30 seconds to throw on PPE.        Using \"due care\" as reasoning to be this reserved does not justify driving in a manner such as this all the time. There needs to be a balance and driving to emergencies is completely fluid based on severity of offense, other motorists, road conditions, etc.       Experience is the better teacher and if an experienced cop were to always be this reserved, they should additionally be prepared to have their actions highly scrutinized by the public and civilly litigated when it results it people dying.         I get where you\\'re coming from but when there is an in-progress violent offense, or mass casualty event taking place, some of these recommendations for driving go straight out the window. Except PPE... where that crap. Damn, my asthma means every cold kicks my ass for 9 days. I just read this from NPR about how N95s are difficult to make, the manufacturers are running above 110% capacity and they are repurposing other factories to produce them ...https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-mak Eh I have asthma and that\\'s pretty much what happens when I get a any old cold.

EUROPE - please, for the love of God, if you are a HCW of any sort and even though Europe is a hotspot for covid-19 and you still decide to go on trips to other countries especially and spend time with your friends, stay home for 14 days as the gov ordered few days ago.

[removed] Seriously, they need to be taking this more seriously and start acting with a sense of urgency. What’s your institutions policy on staff working with URTI or LRTI symptoms? It seems to me that we can’t sustain having everyone off for mostly other viral cases, but that there is a fair bit of cases we will miss and allow to work if we aren’t somewhat strict in HCWs isolating when symptomatic. My wifes hospital is canceling all non emergency surgeries, pretty much just because the lack of PPE I would love to see them get interviewed and try to explain why they chose now of all times to take a completely impromptu road trip. I think in a few weeks Americans will have VERY strong negative feelings towards that kind of completely irresponsible behavior.I literally told my friend, who is objectively brilliant and very well-liked, you could literally be responsible for multiple deaths and never realize it. I have it in writing over text... But that just wasn\\'t a persuasive argument somehow. This past week has honestly changed my opinion on human nature. Personal protective equipment, ie masks, gloves, etc The only issue for the re-usable respirators is that you have to disinfect everything except the filter parts of it before donning/doffing, otherwise you risk infection. They’re unavailable too It’s not about congress moving slow or the president promising to make them available. It hasn’t happened.  End of story.  They need to make it happen NOW otherwise we as healthcare workers are literally enabling the problem to get worse. Is there any _benefit_ to Paracetamol or NSAIDS in COVID.? I have seen several reports of NSAIDs being harmful, and some for paracetamol worsening outcomes in viral infections. Given this, I’m tempted to say just don’t give any paracetamol or NSAIDS unless temperature rises drastically to harmful levels. Would this lead to any harm? Personal Protective Equipment. Exactly.  I’ve seen reports in local news about staff reusing masks.  The FDA and CDC both support this practice in times of critical shortage.  It’s time we alert people that we’re in that period of crisis. Personal Protective Equipment, things like isolation gowns, gloves, &amp; masks. Personal protective equipment I\\'m trying to predict patient flow for my local area. Does anyone have any timeline-type references/resources that I can compare to my anecdotal impression of the emergency department? I\\'ve listened to many of the podcasts from Italian physicians and I feel like I should be anticipating a surge of pneumonias any minute. We started seeing quite a few r/o\\'s about a week ago, and have steadily increased this volume so that about 30% of our census have been symptomatic rule outs as of this weekend. That being said, we have not had very many fulminant cases - maybe 5-10 that I am aware of in the last week or so (my last week\\'s shifts have all been ED - surprise surprise).It doesn\\'t help that our testing remains limited, and with a 3-5 day turnaround still common. My mom is also super religious, lives in south GA. Her church still hasn\\'t canceled services...even though an entire family is in self quarantine due to their (adult) son who lives with them having all the symptoms and is a presumptive case.She refuses to stop attending. She and my dad are both in the high risk group. I explained that asymptomatic people can spread this, and that all it takes is one person in that group to inadvertently spread it to everyone else. Didn\\'t make a difference. Though I did just see that Trump is saying to avoid groups of more than 10 people, so maybe now she\\'ll listen 🙄 I work in an outpatient clinic as well. No PPE available.  It’s on backorder until the end of April.  Doctors are shutting down the office tomorrow and only doing virtual visits.  I support this 100%.  I’d rather lose my job and my paycheck then lose my life or be the reason why another person loses theirs.  My husband is going to work in critical care ONLY IF he has access to N95s.  It’s not hard to see that sick or dead nurses and doctors can’t help anyone.  I don’t understand why individuals voluntarily give up their rights, it only makes the situation worse for everyone. Personal Protective Equipment. Read: Mask/respirator, gloves. Personal Protective Equipment. In this case, referring to masks, face shields, gloves and isolation gowns. Personal Protective Equipment I bought a P100 mask, protects the same as N95 but includes oils, reusable, you can decon it, and currently I haven\\'t seen any shortages of the masks or filter inserts. Also much more comfortable thus more likely to be used.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24011377/ Removed due to Rule 2 Bro that means \"Dipshit tourist\" What is PPE? Improper PPE = unsafe working conditions = right to protest.  Especially during a pandemic when my lack of PPE means that I could potentially infect dozens of others.  To be clear, the teachers didn’t actually strike. They just organized to make it happen if absolutely necessary.  In the same way, healthcare workers could organize to demand access to the national stockpiles of PPE NOW.  And not wait until there are 1000s of us sick and dying as patients on the very units were supposed to staff.... No. 1 rule of ems - don\\'t give somebody else TWO people to save I support any nurse in refusing to work unless they are provided proper PPE.  Period.Edit: spelling austria here. we completed the shutdown today, only providing emergency care now, discharged as many patients as possible. working hour restrictions are suspended, we\\'ll go back to 36h+ shifts and we reduced staff at the hospital to about 20% for now, although i don\\'t expect this to last long. we\\'ll start working in small teams (2 -3 people) from tomorrow on to reduce the impact of quarantine measures. while we are supposed to be the last hospital to treat covid cases in the city, the doubling rate is alarmingly high (\\\\~2.3 days) and we expect a surge sometime next week. pretty surreal feeling right now. I thought there were some in Singapore?  ICU nurse here, we have been lotted to one mask per day if patient is regular droplet (flu/mycoplasm,RSV;etc.) When the patient is POI (person of interest - suspected covid19) we treat them as droplet and are able to throw away masks after use. Only until confirmed positive are we allowed to use face shields, BUT with only a droplet mask still.   Our hospital did not prepare and is trying to order masks late in the game. 10 ICU staff have been sent home on quarantine leave primarily nurses and respiratory.  ICU doctor stated he expects to get sick and would rather get it over with and take up a hospital bed now before it gets terrible. Wash ur hands muh dudes. Not to mention they may not be able to come back home! Then they\\'ll be interviewed on TV as casualties of the terrible lockdown. Gfy! So what does this mean clinically? Like my new ankle tattoo? It means WISDM in Chinese Do you have a link to the sheet you mentioned? I remembered seeing this mentioned (death after a patient appears to recover) but couldn\\'t remember where and wasn\\'t able to find it. Thanks There has been a lot of coverage of this - it was even asked in the White House press conference today. In the legislation being passed, they are trying to allow N95 masks that were made for construction etc by 3M to be used for medical work. They have a LOT more of these - and are making 30 million a month just at 3M. Unfortunately, Congress moves slowly. But expect this to be passed this week and see some supply improvement through an infusion of these masks. Shouting out my RTs forever they\\'ve saved my ass so many times when my pt is trying to die on me or something. Love when they show up when I\\'m in a crunch. Thanks! Fury warrior... Yeah, that\\'s the US. Oh my goodness. Our respiratory therapists are not forgotten over here. You all roam the halls and have had my patients\\' backs time and time again and I am confident that y\\'all will have my back through this pandemic as well. We are a team. All of us. And we are strong, capable, and will make it through this thanks to all of our combined expertise and continued willingness to serve. ✊ Proper translations wouldn\\'t look as cool on a license plate and removes the appeal of \"ooh, Asian proverb much wisdom.\" Keep in mind that a lot of healthcare org inertia comes from heavy baggage around things like regulation and billing that are directed rigidly from the top (i.e. government) down or by other outside factors. [Some places are reporting it in bits and pieces but not getting enough traction?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html)Edited to add that there\\'s a quick mention or 2 of respirators in the article but no real mention of the reality some HCWs are facing. This is exactly what I have heard from other providers in outpatient clinics. I don’t do critical care or anything but like... surely at the point that you’re reusing masks and gloves to that extent you might as well not use PPE? I can’t tell if I’m in the minority for finding this disturbing. i have come to realize that the space between my nose and my upper lip looks ridiculous.

[deleted] Just so I\\'m clear what you\\'re suggesting, you want healthcare workers to strike until hospitals close? During a pandemic? [removed] Minutes to hours, for damage.  But it sounds like you\\'re very in tune with the granular need to control this, and you should reach out to your local hospital or the academic center nearest you to speak to the Pulm/Critical Care docs there. I\\'m a spoiled rotton community EM physician who doesn\\'t have to care for boarded vented ICU patients, so it\\'s been about 5 years since I\\'ve thought very seriously about any of this.  But here\\'s a great well written link to a smart EM/Critical Care blog piece about the implications of messing around with vents which may serve your purposes.   He\\'s coming at it from the idea of splitting a vent between two patients and what that would mean.  (This was actually done on the fly to help trauma patients survive the Las Vegas mass shooting event, which is very different medically as those are young patients not presumed to have lung disease or infectious illness who could be matched up by approx lung volume and had no unusual concerns about lung compliance or oxygenation).   [https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/) Are there any risks of that being hard to come up with or taking more than say a year? I am sure that would be an excellent business now. And really useful for countries to follow up the spread and immunity and establish how well the strategies are working. We\\'re hearing from the Italians that lung compliance tends to be good. Same deal here. Additionally asked not to bring trauma teams into CT area - send 1 person and leave everyone else behind. I agree with you that it\\'s scary and dangerous. The problem is, us not wanting to expose ourselves won\\'t magically make PPE appear. There\\'s a global shortage. This isn\\'t a situation where strike action (formal or informal) means we can influence leaders and effect change to make it safer. Anyone without risk factors refusing to work with the (suboptimal) PPE we have is just increasing the strain on the system. I\\'m not saying any individual has to do it if they don\\'t want to, but don\\'t mistake it for stupidity or a lack of awareness in colleagues who choose to still work as one of the least worst options available. My mother isn\\'t quite Goop level but is attracted to natural remedies like a toddler with bubbles.  I find this article to be very helpful - an MD integrative medicine specialist, but the good kind, and it goes in depth about how we need to first of all make certain that our natural remedies don\\'t interfere with evidence based care, and then appeases her by going into depth about various herbs and stuff.

Teachers planned a sick out in NYC and suddenly the schools closed, RNs need to follow. Why are all proverbs translated without grammar? \"Saving a doctor saves lives.\" Gonna find out tonight. I almost got into an argument with a friend who told me she got a hold of 100 masks and that it wasn\\'t her fault that others weren\\'t prepared for this while she was amassing 4-6 weeks of food for herself and her son. I told her if anything please donate the extra masks. Meanwhile, yeah, this. Reusing masks and gowns and everything, that\\'s so unsafe for the staff. Ughhhh I\\'m always jealous of the US. I wish we had respiratory therapists here, I don\\'t think people here recognise how important good vent settings are to a patients outcome I\\'m expected to manage medications, cares and the ventilator in Australia. It\\'s sad but they won\\'t listen because that hot topic they\\'re spewing hot garbage about is what keeps the listener captivated.

Yes there aren’t enough ventilators...but my local hospital sent out an email informing all clinical staff that they are to wear THE SAME SURGICAL MASK for days or weeks until it is visibly soiled or broken...N95s under lock and key.  What are the conditions like in your hospital/facility? What about reusing surgical masks and gloves between patients for an entire day? As in, taking them on and off? I\\'m curious about the myocarditis secondary to COVID-19. What is its onset relative to time of exposure/onset of symptoms? Have there been any predictors for who has gotten it? Any effective treatments? Yeah. I\\'ve submitted it as a text post to the subreddit, hopefully more people can see it that way.The full report is really something. Excellent, thank you. Key points from the summary:&gt; We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. Mitigation works, but not well enough.&gt;Suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \\\\[...\\\\] will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. Suppression is of course optimal from a purely epidemiological perspective, but can we bear the costs of shutting down huge parts of our economy for an extended period of time?Looking forward to reading the full report when I have time, great find. &gt; (emphasis mine) I\\'ve had a **chest pressure almost like you feel like you\\'ve done a big chest workout**. I\\'ve had a little bit of a cough. I had a relatively mild fever. I\\'ve had kind of weird aches and pains in places I\\'m not used to. But honestly, I feel like I\\'ve had colds and flus worse than this. **I\\'ve never been totally out for the whole day in bed.** I\\'ve been up, able to talk with people. So for me, luckily, it\\'s been quite mild.Considering it\\'s not ARDS, yes it might be mild COVID19 but that sounds pretty severe in my professional opinion, lol I\\'m not doing telehealth, but my understanding was that for medicare you use E&amp;M codes + a telehealth modifier, though im not sure the modifier, 95, GT, or something else. I caught that. I meant \"keep going\" with the other spelling mishaps, but it\\'s not your job. Me? I work in the \"a/an\" pet-peeve department. i know..........dont do it Right?? I dont understand the logic of these patients. Also frustrated at my residency program for not taking it more seriously and only allowing urgent appointments at our clinic. Infuriating. There’s no discharge in the war Yes! I want to tweet it. There’s such a huge medical presence in Twitter. Just not sure how easy it is to track and fire me. &gt; _sighs_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should.Fuck Trump and his shithole administrration. (from an american) YES. As Koreans been saying, SAVE DR SAVE LIFE. Applies to other health prof ofc. isnt it enraging? It sounds like there are pretty considerable reasons why the rads residents can\\'t work from home. I dunno, I feel more concern for the EM/gas/ICU fellows who have to be exposed to aerosolized secretions to be honest. Here\\'s the data underlying the UK government\\'s response - and they\\'ve modelled the US as well. This is the report that has resulted in the UK\\'s latest social distancing measures.Highlights include: deaths in the US of approximately 1 million people. Peak demand more than 8x greater ICU surge capacity in both the US and UK. Any social distancing measures must be in place until a vaccine is disseminated.Report 9https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/ I think our best guess at this comes from comparing the curves of the pace at which new cases were identified.  I found one graph that implies we have tried to establish quarantine a few days ahead of where Italy was, which sounds hopeful.  On the other hand, they have more hospital beds per capita than we do, which is depressing.  \"your laying in a hospital bed\" Just correcting my pet peeve ;) Keep going... Very well worded comment. It might just save lives. All of the coronavirus-related articles on NY times site are free but you\\'ll have to create an account. Hope this helps. Looking at this article, the design I\\'m envisioning would follow the \"biphasic ventilation\" model seen about 2/3 the way down this link.  It\\'d be a disposable connection set that would take advantage of an existing intermitting suction regulator and a positive pressure source to create the alternation needed for breathing. Both pressures would be fully adjustable by clinicians.  So while there\\'d be no automation available, it might be manageable if there were enough hands but not enough ventilators.https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/304068-overview#a7What timescale does the harm you\\'re referring to occur across? It could sort of fit under the code blue admonishment of checking your own pulse first. I agree it would’ve explicitly been in there if it were more timely. EXACTLY. If we can give front line workers extra time to fix the shortages of PPE and critical care equipment, we\\'re helping them (which means saving not only their lives, but their patients as well) Have there been any studies/surveys showing that HCWs actually are getting higher rates of severe disease? I agree. As a radiology resident, I\\'m OK with my attendings--many of whom are much older than me--staying home and working from there rather than risk getting infected. We might need some attendings for any urgent procedures, but otherwise, us seniors can handle a lot on our own.And like Boomboomgel said, home reading stations are expensive. You should not use just any old computer monitor, for example, as they may not provide the adequate luminance and resolution for optimal diagnostic decisions. Further details are available in the ACR-AAPM-SIIM Technical Standard for Electronic Practice of Medical Imaging. Good advice. Thank you. It\\'s probably important to remember scale. 0.2% is still 60,000 20-35 year olds dead at 50% saturation. That doesn\\'t even account for hospitalizations or long term lung damage. That’s fair. Good points. I’ve got no problem with someone putting an amethyst in their shoe or whatever, as long as that person is taking other precautions. Unfortunately, this kind of balanced, dual approach does not appear to be the norm. Paywall for me? New meta-analysis of of Covid-19 out on preprint. Key findings: dyspnoea key predictive symptom for ICU admission and severe disease; COPD, cardiovascular disease and hypertension also predictive.https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1 Any links or texts that explain the minutiae of it I could look into? No antibody tests currently but I’m sure there will be in the future Just took a knee for you I agree, both these cases surpassed my expectation of mild I\\'m sorry, you absolutely are and vital! ahh enjoy your comp! Best type of vacation cause no guilty feelings for turning into a complete potato. Though I have to clean up, the state of my apartment is.... well, nightshift mess. It was actually my first time working nightshift ever. Yeah. I wonder what the world will look like in 2 weeks... or a month? How our daily lives will look like... German study N=9 of viral shedding characteristics in confirmed Covid patients. Very high viral load early in illness, approx 1000 times greater than SARS. At DAY 8 of active symptoms, no longer able to detect active virus in samples, only viral RNA. Only viral RNA in feces, never detected active virus.They\\'re following up now with N=23 cohort.[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1) I mean the ED is about to go completely bonkers. The EM docs already don\\'t like the turn around time for scans. I suppose outpatient imaging will be down so hopefully that\\'ll make up for the increase in volume. They absolutely *will* fire people.  Hospitals are not run by doctors, they’re run by businessmen. This is exactly how I feel and I am so frustrated. I told him he just needs to wear a mask for each patient. If they run out don’t go in because it’s not worth it for anyone - his patients, his family, his own health given his age and HPN Dynamic control of volume and pressure are required, these are both moving targets that progress as the illness evolves over a few days and under or over doing it causes real harm Well they don\\'t have home reading stations, for starters. Those stations are very expensive. But also radiologists do perform procedures, go down to the ED on occasion for various things related to the scans like consenting people and such. And it leaves the PGY5s kind of out there, in that they\\'ll be the primary folks supervising the PGY4-2s. So it\\'ll be like it is when they\\'re on call except it\\'s during the day and during a pandemic. IDK, I\\'m probably just being irritable. To me it just seems like if from a nursing standpoint all the charge nurses and nurse managers were just like \"Ok guys, good luck! I\\'ll be available by telephone if you need me!\" Anybody have thoughts on how to best utilize home health services if we end up getting a bed crunch?  If people are just requiring supplemental O2 would it not be reasonable to try for early discharge and home management? There are so many things going on at our institution that are making me uncomfortable also. This is not going to go well. This makes a lot of sense While I agree with what you are saying, it’s unfortunate that Respiratory Therapists weren’t mentioned when we are just as on the front lines as you nurses. We’ll be intubating these people. And managing their vents. I don’t have the links at hand but there is a pdf on the CDC website and there are videos from Britain’s NHS out there. Both are good. Also, simply searching YouTube videos from trusted sources (med centers, government agencies, etc) is what I’ve been telling people to do. Anyone doing telehealth in Primary care?  How are you doing your visit coding?I think this is the correct CMS referrence but it is listing codes like 99215.  Does it need a modifier to indicate telelhealth?https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/TelehealthSrvcsfctsht.pdf so if it\\'s old people and attractive young people, does that mean I\\'m excluded from getting the virus lol *you\\'re You get the local DA office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. this was posted previously:https://emcrit.org/ibcc/covid19/#personal_protective_equipment_(PPE) Probably reporting (media) bias. If there\\'s 100 cases,  99 older and 1 attractive young person,  who is the media going to report on? Not saying it doesn\\'t happen,  but these rare cases do seem to be circulated a lot more than the standard ones. I\\'m guessing the fury warrior pulled aggro. Honestly, minimizing risk for ANY healthcare worker is imperative at this moment. Why risk infecting a radiologist who can provide diagnostic support during the coming surge from afar? Unless I’m mistaken, is it essential that they are present in the hospital during the outbreak? We need all hands on deck but that can come in many forms. Unnecessary exposure will just cause more spread and more problems.  You get the local attorney office to subpoena the store that sold it. Then you get the local sheriff to go and seize it from the hoarders. Why can\\'t residents work from home Exactly. We\\'ve not even begun the war against covid, so to speak and we\\'re already dangerously low of PPE. It\\'s reassuring to hear from a fellow colleague with a level head. We need to be protecting ourselves first, and not act heroic and kill ourselves and in turn, other colleagues and patients. OURS. Thanks. We\\'re out here on the front line with no rapid testing and no PPE. There\\'s no other industry in *existence* that would be asked to work under those conditions. You stay home to slow this thing down until someone figures out how to properly protect health care employees.It\\'s the LEAST we deserve for taking this burden on. Glad to see some action in major cities. I\\'m in NYC, and the streets are getting a bit emptier but not as empty as I hoped. There\\'s still quite a few people commuting to work and hanging out in groups. Public schools are closed and transitioning to online learning until April 20, universities have moved online for the foreseeable future and some have kicked students out of dorms. Restaurants and bars are either closed or takeout/delivery only - many are struggling trying to pay their employees. Nightclubs, movie theaters, and concert venues are closed. We have a covid patient who presented as presumed STEMI later determined to be likely viral myocarditis. My hospital is wasting N95 masks on elective cases today.We’ve been told over and over - “business as usual”Our elective surgeries continue to flow in. And now, due to concern about ‘aerosolization’, OR staff are being told to wear N95 masks for some of these cases.So to recap - still doing elective cases. Burning through N95 masks.Does anyone know if I can make an anonymous Twitter handle and tweet about this without getting doxed? The system here is already fucked because we don\\'t even have enough PPE. We absolutely need to slow down the spread. What characteristics of a ventilator are critical to their function that this would miss?  I know not having them electronically follow the patients\\' breathing patterns is not ideal, but it would seem something that forced them into a regular 4 second breathing pattern would be a better than nothing.  I\\'m talking in a scenario like Italy has where some patients are simply not getting any respiratory support due to a shortage of equipment.  Adding negative pressure rooms to our list. My hospital system is treating everyone with respiratory symptoms as droplet precautions from now until ? LEEEERRROOOOYYYYYYYYYY Neither of these cases seem mild to me, and certainly not enough to blame on a gym workout! Mild enough to blow off to me is a day or two of sore throat and sniffles and back to normal. Sure, but his comment didn\\'t specify that those things weren\\'t taken into account. People with asthma don\\'t necessarily get more severe illness with this strain according to some of the preliminary data. There is not nearly enough data to give you much more than that. one trillion upvotes- more of my questions answered How many lives? This is great. Would you be up for reposting this as a separate thread for maximum exposure? Ha I also have comp after night shift this week. I’m supposed to be in clinic next week but I have no idea what that will look like. Kite them!  Kite them! As a healthcare worker with asthma and also I\\'m fat, how fucked am I?  Other than using recommended PPE, any recommendations?  Nursing staff ain\\'t always the healthiest bunch.Edit: I\\'m on a med surg floor once a week. &gt; EDIT: how can I explain to my father that he needs to tell the office manager that it does not make sense to only wear a mask after you’ve been in contact with a patient with COVID-19 and everyone should be wearing one when interacting with patients?You can\\'t fix stupid China did, then I\\'m not sure if a hunter misdirected, or someone ran away from the group, but theres adds everywhere now What a pisspoor idea. I feel like they are leaving the residents out to dry. Look into how to create negative pressure rooms.  We need a lot more than we have, and working at a suction device manufacturer makes you keenly suited to the task.  Good luck! I personally haven\\'t seen stats that say otherwise. It simply seems the quantity of elderly facing this disease is far overshadowing the numbers in younger people.Percentage wise, younger people are less at risk, but the risk is still non-zero (and seemingly much higher than the flu). Good bot. My department is having daily town hall meetings. Via Microsoft Teams (virtual town hall). pull the fire alarm before it starts? &gt;.&lt; seriously, try to send the message up the chain how bad of an idea that is. We suspended all stuff like that two weeks or so ago. Why are you pissed? It is reddit, you are American until proven otherwise :pbut yeah... unfortunately the global trend seems to follow the US atm... \\\\_sighs\\\\_ but we should stop before we start talking politics. They should not matter atm, just stopping this should. A lot of churches are doing their services online which is smart. Sounds more like constant emergency 24/7. I\\'m not jealous of them. But I respect the fuck out of their work! Here’s another interesting first hand account of a mild case from someone with confirmed pcr:https://www.facebook.com/EbethBerkeley/posts/10110434821081713Claimed symptoms paint an interesting picture Hahahaha I did not notice that! I am so not correcting that... On the [This Week in Virology podcast](http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) prof Ralph Baric had the intriguing hypothesis that the endemic human coronaviruses that cause the common cold could have been very serious sars like diseases for adults when initially introduced from animals. This would have the implication that the only reason they are not deadly now is that we develop immunity from exposure as children and then get mild disease as adults when re-infected. If this is true then SARS-2 will eventually become the 3rd human coronavirus that causes just the common cold in people.A highly recommended listen! &gt; Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.Hopefully in a few months we\\'ll have a better handle (more PPE, more vents, more beds, more knowledge, more treatment options) on this than we do now... Buying time saves lives. Your message is *super* important, and will hopefully help keep people alive.In a previous era of life, I had a long and full career in law enforcement.  I used to teach new, young, gung-ho academy graduates that when you\\'re responding to an emergency call, a crime in progress, etc., with lights and siren going, to do the following:  Drive only a small, reasonable bit above the speed limit, and maybe at or below the speed limit.  Stop at every single red light and stop sign.  Completely stop.  Wait a second or three.  Look around. Make sure everyone has stopped for you.  *Then* go through it and continue on.   Don\\'t drive faster than the sound from your siren.  Stay far enough back from traffic you\\'re coming up to and be patient to let them have time to hear your siren and notice your lights in their mirror(s) and get out of your way.You **must** be wearing your bulletproof vest, **every** day, no matter the duty, location, season, temperature, humidity, etc.You **must** get out of your car slowly.

I know you meant \"re-exposed\" but somehow \"re exploded\" is just as fitting :( It\\'s very sad, but it\\'s not a direct pathology of the disease. The thought would be “are you kidding me” WHOAH WHO SAID I WAS REFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES?! Just messing.... I was :( Luks? Yeah we are not there yet (USB). They are starting to cancel electives and have said that we can be moved to other duties. I will be reading up on relevant things this week (I have comp week after a week of nightshift). Honestly don\\'t know what I\\'ll be returning to next week. Referral specialist for an HMO here - still getting a ton of referrals for non-urgent issues.  I\\'m a little dumbfounded at how many people want to see the doctor right now for their moles or their genetic testing...you know, the things that can wait 2 weeks?  Very frustrating to see. Yes. My girlfriend is from Texas and I am so glad that 1st I was born here and 2nd I was finally able to bring her here last summer. Radiology attendings at an unspecified academic program are going to be telecommuting from their home stations now. My husband is all \"Eh, shit rolls downhill\" but I\\'m pissed. Is this the norm in radiology departments elsewhere during this crisis? https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/tagesschau-spezial/video/medienkonferenz-des-bundesrates-zum-coronavirus?id=6329d7d0-e1e9-4221-a091-3dbba7b7fd43here (in German/French/Italian/Romantsch obv). Skip to 5:00 to hear the opening speech.  It feels. Warm. I rarely feel like I am part of something, but rn I kinda do. I hesitate to say \"proud\" because it isn\\'t like I did anything for it. Relief knowing that our government actually tries to help the people.   You have to understand the difference in system. The executive branch is the federal council, consisting of 7 members distributed proportionally to the share of vote that the parties got. So there are right and left wing and center people in there but they always speak with one voice towards the outside. There is no party politics involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland) if you wanna read some about it) Or the hospital will give it to them.....my hospital just came out with the same policy to continue Spain was partying a week ago while Italy was starting to be ravaged.  Now they know and are trying to tell us to do the same.Icarus..... Anyone got a good presentation about Proper ppe for covid 19? Or any good source. Much Appreciated. They don\\'t care. Our CMO sent out an email saying electives will go on. It was replied to by the President and CEO congratulating her for not falling into the \"hype\". This is a large, multi state regional enterprise/level 1 trauma center.  Hope none of the dozen+ cataract cases or hundred other electives brought us a surprise thank you gift today. Must be nice to have a government that puts its people above politics Okay but who\\'s tanking this boss?

In the context of COVID-19.](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang)\"13 Mar 2020Based on initial reports from China, and subsequent evidence that arterial hypertension may be associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 infected subjects, hypotheses have been put forward to suggest a potential adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). It has been suggested, especially on social media sites, that these commonly used drugs may increase both the risk of infection and the severity of SARS-CoV2. The concern arises from the observation that, similar to the coronavirus causing SARS, the COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 levels are increased following treatment with ACE-i and ARBs.\\xa0Because of the social media-related amplification, patients taking these drugs for their high blood pressure and their doctors have become increasingly concerned, and, in some cases, have stopped taking their ACE-I or ARB medications.This speculation about the safety of ACE-i or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scientific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is no data in humans.The [Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)) wish to highlight **the lack of any evidence**supporting harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.The Council on Hypertension **strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the Covid-19 infection.** *Prof. Giovanni de Simone,**Chair, ESC Council on Hypertension**On behalf of the Nucleus Members\"* I\\'m not sure what to believe... we have so many reports of young people critically ill, but stats say otherwise... what do you guys think? Obviously this is a question everyone has People need to stop standing in fire I know. It\\'s a terrible situation. World-changing situation. I really don\\'t know what the world is going to look like in a year. &gt; We\\'re being threatenedI\\'m not in the US and this is a terrible situation they are putting you in, but they are not going to fire medical staff with this going on.  Stand firm and get your colleagues to stand firm, insist on the PPE or walk out until it\\'s there.  As the post above says you can\\'t help anyone for the time you\\'re down with the virus (or dead) If you\\'re refusing report because you don\\'t have proper PPE, I believe you\\'d win the argument. If you\\'re refusing because you\\'re scared, you\\'d probably lose. In my community, it\\'s the boomers who are flippant about this and think it won\\'t affect them. I just got into it today with one of them about closing her yoga studio and deleting her posts about how wellness based lifestyle can prevent illness... Just to say, please don\\'t turn this into an Us vs Them thing. There are idiots in all age groups. Yep. Analyzing clinical presentation and symptoms does not work well for us. The very first patient tested positive at our ER had nothing more than a sore throat and got tested because he attended a carnival attend which became infamous for spread (at a point where there were still no cases). Guy was a homework tutor at an elementary school, luckily of over 220 tested children and parents none positive but this could have easily gone south if the ER didn\\'t fish him out.  This is all public information revealed in press conferences and articles at this point, if you are concerned about confidentiality. Awesome information! This is just what I was looking for. Now I just need to brush up on my German. Same here lol. Came in this morning and noticed that quite a few of us had shaved clean over the weekend, the initial shock as we saw each other’s beardless faces after years was great.

WHO pulls their US numbers from [CDC\\'s page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html), which is reporting just over 1600 cases while the actual number of positives [sits at over 4100](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en).P.S. The second link compiles data from various health department sites and breaks it down by state and county. More detailed reports can be found further down the page. If any mods are reading, I think it\\'s worth a sticky. Does anyone have any experience with appropriate coding/encounter type/billing for telephone encounters? This would be for patients calling for COVID rule-out/guidance as well as possibly folks who have needs that could be met without an in-person visit.Trying to help with an institutional response in a rural area. Thanks! The amount of bull shit I hear from radio hosts in the car is astounding. It’s more mild than the flu, it’s the media, it’s a left wing political move. It’s insane that these people are even allowed to make comments about it. I’ve tried to call in to at least warn them that they should leave those kinds of statements to people in the medical field without luck. &gt; Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown?What\\'s the goal behind \"shut everything down\"?  Realistically, we are not going to get the infection rate to 0 even if we shut everything down for a couple months.  Even if we are wildly successfully and knock down infections to 20 across the country, we will be back to ~20,000 in a couple months.  The time where a total shutdown is needed is if we get into an Italy or Wuhan situation where the system is overrun.  Then it makes sense to knock the infections down to a point where they can be handled.The changes that need to be made are the ones that slow the spread while normal life continues.  Shutting everything down is a delaying tactic and not a permanent solution Oh.  Oh boy. I hadn’t been clean shaven in a decade. I look like a high schooler. The inevitable ingrown hairs while my skin adjusts will really complete the teenager look. Here\\'s the [CDC guidelines for breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fpregnancy-faq.html) as a person with known or suspected covid 19. That might be helpful as you\\'re trying to figure out the best course of action. Thanks so much for mentioning more possible symptoms to look out for! Thanks so much! :) Why hasn\\'t WHO released a daily sitrep today? Pardon the really weird analogy from video games.Something I learned playing MMORPGs - We have a bit of wisdom when 20+ people are fighting bosses:\"Dead Damage Dealers do no damage. Dead Healers do no healing.\"The throughput of those alive are infinitely better than those who are dead (or incapacitated). It is not worth that extra bit of throughput if it will cost your life. Contributions will be much greater alive than dead.It is totally the turtle and the hare situation, except instead of the hare slacking off, it\\'s the hare being sick.EDIT: To add - \"When the Healers are dead, everyone is dead.\" Real Life Healthcare Professionals, take care of yourselves. You\\'re too important to lose. We\\'re being threatened, the union is trying but getting stonewalled. It doesn\\'t help the CDC keeps changing the recommendations. Who do we believe! The Chinese in ground zero wearing HazMat? Or the CDC who ( and this may have changed now, hopefully, without my knowledge ) was only letting one company manufacturer COVID19 Tests??I asked what would happen if we refused to accept report on assignments with a COVID19 patient and I haven\\'t gotten an answer. Thank you for being human and trying to help out. I don\\'t think your ventilator idea would work, however if your machines can create negative pressure rooms that would be greatly needed. Thanks! I appreciate it. : ) Math is a thing used by epidemiologists, who take into account important things like disease latency, incubation periods, true incidence vs. apparent incidence, etc.Nothing about math teaches you that. Only the other way around. I’m about to shave mine. I’m a new attending and look like a med student without it. Working on the ED I don’t think it’s feasible to use the PAPR that often for the number of people I’m gonna have to put on BiPAP or tube.Question: are we now assuming every COPD exacerbation has COVID-19 until proven otherwise? Called to a code last night (pharmacist). Our boss said we shouldn’t go to codes of COVID patients bc we are non essential and need to save PPE. We are told to keep the med drawer of the cart outside the room along with rsi kit and hand meds in. I’m not sure what that is going to look like. Last night I asked if isolation patient and the response I got was “not yet”. Arrested at home after a couple days cheat pain. So I go to the code and the MD is fully PPE covered, mask and face shield. No one else is. I’m wondering- are ED physicians just wearing garb the whole shift? I can’t imagine keeping it on and walking from room to room but I am not up there full time so I don’t know. Yah but what are healthcare professionals suppose to do with the lack of prep? The people voted for this current administration... I hope for nurses and doctors sake that they strike after all this. Hard too. They are put at unnecessary risk because of our current state of healthcare. Should be done, thanks for the reminder! I suggest we add an exception to rule #10 specifically for [reacting to healthcare workers who\\'ve had to shave :(](https://giphy.com/gifs/afv-americas-funniest-home-videos-26vUN2RR48dddT1Cg) You do not see patients until you get any. You close down until you do. You can not put yourself at risk. this needs its own thread.. Yes, the number of antecdotal reports is alarming. As of yesterday, the German national status report of the RKI has 3024 cases with full clinical data. Only 39% of these positive tested patients presented with fever! (Source in German: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-03-15-de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) I agree 1,000% with you. Just yesterday one of my good friends announced to me that he and two others are taking a road trip south. Mind you they work in NYC, and mind you that just on Saturday they attended a party with 10+ nurses who work at a hospital with confirmed covid. I tried explaining why it was an absolutely horrible and selfish idea to go at this time. He responded \"points taken\" and today I got a picture from a friend of a friend of them on the road. I still can\\'t fucking believe it. I never understood how arrogant and selfish the average American is. What do we do if our hospital has no more P.P.E. What criteria are CDC using for \"recovery\"? There was an internist cheat sheet I saw the other day from Italy that described the above. It basically said don’t trust the first patient rally. I believe a lot of our ignorance is due to the fact of information overload. There are thousands upon thousands of people telling us to do X or Y. One physician says wear masks, another says don’t. Things like these take a toll on the regular American Citizen. Also anyone can post on the internet. Those on the corona subreddit. Or news. Or world news. Are their posts always true? Nope but it’s not like it matters. The moderators on the forums (not even exclusively Reddit), are they healthcare professionals? Nah probably not. Then we turn to the administration, are they professionals? Nah. No, that\\'s not how epidemiology works. If it did, epidemiology wouldn\\'t exist. State of emergency for all of Switzerland. All non-essential stores and public venues closed. Strongly suggested to stay home. Home office if at any way possible. For risk population wages are guaranteed even if home office is not an option. Army will be deployed to help hospitals. Call for all Swiss abroad on vacation to come home. Closing of the borders for non-essential travel.I almost cried. Finally. Also great somber speech of our president. She emphasized the important points in all 4 languages. With hospitals already telling critical staff (ICU/er) that they are going to have to rely on surgical masks it seems like healthcare workers are in for a hell of a time.  So in theory while you would have unlimited resources and be in full PPE the reality is going to be healthcare workers are at incredible risk wearing gear far below the standard they should. I think that is the definition of an emergency in a pandemic - we simply don’t have the supplies on hand required. My wife is an ER physician and we have a 4 week old baby. She will likely be returning to work earlier than planned due to the virus.  We are hoping she can stay out at least a few more weeks.Stay safe everyone. Humanity\\'s arrogance. Shit like this has happened everywhere. Just look at the members of that church/cult? in SK. We are seeing lots of exhaustion, depression, even suicide in stressed out systems.  I know nothing about this particular case, but non COVID causes are certainly plausible. Agree Hmm. If that is Covid that would be an entirely new presentation.... Myocarditis and arrest is becoming more reported, and more commonly how young folks are dying I am literally in an argument with my best-friend cousin about whether or not this is a big deal. She lives in DC, I live in Seattle. She is not listening to me. She is angry her son is missing 2 weeks of school. I\\'m worried I might be homeless in 6 months. Or dead. But those are healthy, compliant lungs. Totally different if you have intrinsic lung disease.It may still come to it, but don’t expect miracles. The wonderful thing about math is that it can be checked by anyone who knows their stuff. Maybe this \"chucklehead\" is a crank, maybe not, but unless you\\'re good at math and have checked their numbers yourself, your dismissal of it seems like another form of anti-intellectualism to me. There were a lot of nerdy people ringing the alarm bell on this disease weeks before the mainstream picked up on it, and I saw a lot of this same \"who made you an expert?\" attitude among people who were in denial up until recently, or even still. I’m glad you’re taking this level of care in your planning. I like all your ideas. I know hospitals that aren’t this regimented! I have nothing to add but I’m so thankful for people like you who are taking it seriously. F [removed] My hypothesis is that the economy is on the verge of crumbling.&amp;#x200B; Businesses will go under, leading to layoffs, which will lead to less spending, which will lead to businesses going under,which will lead to layoffs, which will lead to less spending. Shall I continue?&amp;#x200B;V 2 of the hypothesis is that they are already aware they must scale back, however the markets are hyper-reactive and emotional so you cannot just announce \\'\\'we\\'re stopping all flights, mandating all businesses closed and a curfew after 6pm\". The trump announcement on european travel ban created a massive drop in the market after hours.The worrying part is that once it comes out that the hospitals aren\\'t able to help everyone, then we will see the true gruesome nature of this pandemic.It is right about that time people will realize \\'\\'oh jeez, more serious than I thought\\'\\' I would like a moment of silence for my facial hair - I am going to shave tonight. The one N95 mask I have been permitted to have for each clinical encounter in my clinic needs to do the best it can.I fear my daughter will not know who i am.If you have went back to looking like a teenager as I will soon do, please offer any words of comfort you may have. F Is there currently a way to test if you have had a previous infection by Covid-19? If not will it be possible in a close future? I figure this will be even more interesting in the coming weeks to understand how the herd immunity status is. And also when a lot of countries are only testing seriously ill patients. I assume the current tests only spill the news of a potential on-going infection? everyone will catch the shit out of this virus AFAIK all the hospitals in Seattle have put a stop those. I\\'m not even bothering to go see my ortho this week. No point now. &gt; For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis Hahaha!Shit. :( Call your governor’s office.  Local government.  Tell other parents to do the same.  The state superintendent’s office needs to hear your concerns! As a Seattlite, I love that idea. I hate what it means for our city, but I love that idea! she may need to pump and let you give that to them. uptodate mentions trying to be as careful as possible but i can\\'t imagine how you avoid transmission during breastfeeding given the baby is directly in line with your respiration. &gt; But everything floating around is hearsay. We all need to remember that. I\\'m currently operating under the assumption of higher viral load for HCW causing higher rates of severe disease. All the more reason to adhere to strict PPE. States with any real numbers of cases are taking it seriously. I\\'m in WA and Inslee just closed entertainment places including bars and restaurants. All K-12 are closed, and colleges/unis are doing all online courses through April. I think we\\'re heading for a huge global depression. We MIGHT get a new New Deal out of it, but let\\'s be honest, we don\\'t have much wiggle room right now. We\\'re still in debt as a nation from the last crisis. &gt; IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. They\\'re not, because they didn\\'t get there using logic. You can\\'t logic someone out of a position they hold due to feelings. Thank you! I remember working the ED for months from the floatpool during the Ebola outbreak. Quarantining half of it for dedicated use on presenting pts. No one panicked, but the hair on the back of your neck sure did raise every time that bell rang for new admission. Just remember, you can\\'t help someone else if you\\'re incapacitated. Stay strong everyone, and take care. I wish people in my fathers office would think this way. The CMO told them that until a provider is actually sick, you should keep seeing patients, even after being exposed to someone with the virus. I have to wonder how many other rural clinics are being this cavalier. &gt; But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.I keep trying to tell people on various subreddits that just because they\\'re sick, that doesn\\'t mean they need to be tested. I just keep getting downvoted. If you know they are exceeding the number limit, report them. They will at least get a nice big fine and hopefully not make idiotic choices again, plus the gathering will be broken up. This is so vitally important. It will require very active suppression of honed clinical muscle memories and learned responses. It will not be easy but it is the only way forward. He’s an elderly petulant child Hey there, I noticed previous threads are often automatically set sort by New, is there anyway to change this thread to do the same? (Thank you again for all you’ve done the past few weeks, and in general!) What are you talking about.  One of Trump\\'s desperate staffers was able to grab his phone and make him tweet, \"Social Distancing!\"That\\'ll make all of his dumb%#* followers fall in line right? &gt; I expect many event cancellations will be announced today or later this week, as it\\'s pretty hard to justify doing anything else at this point, though people still find a way...And Seattle has to keep dealing with that jackass [Tim Eyman](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/coronavirus-daily-news-update-march-14-what-to-know-today-about-covid-19-in-the-seattle-area-washington-state-and-the-nation/), calling for a gathering of \"250 patriots\" to flout Jay Inslee\\'s ban on crowds. &gt;There is no emergency in a pandemic.If the book *House of God* took place during a pandemic, this would be one of the rules. Possibly an unpopular opinion.  If you choose to go out to bars or travel you should put your name on a list.  People on the list start at the bottom when it comes to the rationing of medical supplies.  If I’m self isolating and not doing anything risky, I should be able to get a vent before a millennial who doesn’t think their actions have consequences. If you were like me you saw tons of people out this weekend. I don’t think we did enough, soon enough. Closing restaurants and bars before the weekend would have really been great, but at this point you have to think it’s coming a little late. But better late than never. I\\'ve been asked to be part of a testing team and the biggest part of my thought process is my 3600 dollar deductible. It is sad that as a health care provider I have to worry about the massive bill that simply doing my job could end up delivering me. Yes, it seems to follow the pattern of looking well enough for discharge then tanking...i only hope there are enough clinicians out there who are aware to be on the lookout for this and can hopefully prevent some cases from slipping through. My mom is super religius and lives in San Diego (not very hard hit yet). Her church cancelled all activities as of last week. I\\'m VERY happy about that!Now if only Seattle could keep Tim Eyman away from the internet and the outside world for 3 months, that\\'d be great. Is there any large scale data on afebrile presentations of covid-19? There seems to be a belief in the general population that no fever=no coronavirus and much of the screening advice seems to focus around fever as well. [This article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article) describes two younger patients, one who was afebrile throughout the course of the disease and one who was febrile for only 3 days. Both had positive PCR results for at least 20 days. My mom and my RN aunt are harping on my elderly mom with COPD to stay away from people. I am not sure she\\'s listening. But she\\'s proud of me!!! Yay. Simplest answer: no one knows. We were likely too late but we will see in 10-14 days where we are. If we manage to make it through fairly unscathed as a nation then everything we have done will have worked but will be seen by the lay public as overreaction. If it doesn’t work and we end up in an Italy like situation, then I’m afraid the same public will say it didn’t matter what we did, it was gonna happen regardless. In my opinion, I feel that everyone in the country will directly know personal family with this disease. Stuff like that, given our population now, rarely happens. As stated this is just one guy’s opinion, though &gt; and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiologyThere\\'s some chucklehead on /r/CoronavirusWA who keeps posting trend lines of infected and death rates. I asked him why he thought he had the expertise to draw any conclusions from that information, and he said \"I\\'m good at math.\" LOL ok dude. It\\'s to flatten the curve, make sure that people don\\'t all get sick at the same time and overwhelm the medical system.We\\'re not stopping this. It\\'s out there. We\\'ve just got to get through it and meet on the other side of it. She. But it would be a great name for her &gt; Dr actonFor just a second I thought his name was Dr. Action and I was like, \"Yeah, that\\'s fitting!!\" I\\'ve always said that if I were an evil genius and wanted to eradicate a group of anti-vaxxers that the best intervention would be....convince them not to get vaccines. I think that Covid is the equivalent for anti government and anti-science groups. They will catch the shit out of this virus. Nothing in the news yet but a coworker of his facebooked about it; link to COVID is completely unknown at this time, he had not been known to be ill the day before. Simply found inexplicably dead. Medical device R&amp;D engineer here.  I work for a small suction regulator company  and we\\'re trying to see if there\\'s any way for us to help on the supply chain side.We\\'re not equipped to help with high volume things like masks and other PPE, but one thing I keep seeing is a shortage of ventilators in the worst hit areas.  Could a low tech \"ventilator\" that oscillates between a specific positive pressure and a weakly negative pressure/atmospheric pressure be helpful at timed intervals be helpful in scenarios where there aren\\'t enough ventilators go around? Are there any other things I should be looking into? Except of course the 50,000 who died. That is of course the problem with percentages is that it is pretty easy to have 18 times the people who died in the Iraq war and 9/11 when you turn it into a percentage. He already said he takes no responsibility We must spread this wisdom ASAP Engineering orgs are often more forward-thinking than healthcare orginazations, as someone who has worked in both That\\'s not how people will look at it though.  It is:Option 1: 4.95% chance of death and a year+ disruption to economic and social life.Option 2: 5% chance of death and we get it over with in a few months.Pretty much everyone is going to take option 2. I also work for the NHS and have no intention of going down with the ship (if it\\'s sinking due to lack of PPE).  If we run out of PPE, I am not going near Covid-19.  There are many stories of young healthcare workers getting very ill and dying from Covid even with PPE. It\\'s scary and downright dangerous that the virus has barely scratched the NHS and many trusts are already running low on vital PPE. I\\'m currently reading PFTs (Pulm/CC Fellow) and trying to get my department to cancel all the PFTs and exercise tests. The only part of these that is closed to outside air is the lung volumes, so all these susceptible patients with COPD etc are going to be spraying droplets all over the room with a RT and sometimes a fellow who are going to be badly needed when shit hits the fan. Thanks for posting this. You’ve highlighted my thoughts exactly. The thing is, I (working for the NHS) don’t want to crash along with it. Nor do I want the NHS or the UK to crash, but that’s not something I can control! I have coworkers who are openly talking about having their own big at Patrick’s day party tomorrow at their house because all the bars are closed and in defiance of the 100 person limit in our state. Literally people who take care of sick trauma patients everyday but their St. Patrick’s day boozefest is more important and then I’m stuck being unable to prevent exposure or spread because they don’t care and I still have to show up to work and work next to them. What are all those naval mercy hospital ships up to?  Is it time to think about recalling them? I cant imagine parking a 1000 bed hospital outside of Seattle would be a bad idea right now. Sobering. Thank you. I\"m seeing this more in the context of people who regularly use NSAIDs. There\\'s a lot of talk about stopping them because if you get sick it would make the sickness worse. For example people who take naproxen for an inflammatory arthritis or something like that. Truly sobering. Under your scenario, every month we prolong the spread is worth up to 8,000 lives. If they willfully infect the entire population then a year\\'s worth of ICU beds goes to waste, and up to 80,000 people die needlessly.  I really wish people would listen to medical professionals when they tell you lifestyle choices are the number one thing you can do to improve and maintain good health. Instead, many people do what they want and then,  when it hits the fan, they want a magic remedy. I hope In the future we spend more time learning and understanding as patients about public health and our responsibilities to care for ourselves. Fox is like crack cocaine. My coworker has been estranged by his son for several years because of it. He told me \"I\\'m addicted to it. I know that. I can\\'t help it\". I thought it so bizarre he said that. Nothing conclusive (obviously, too early) but data from other coronaviruses indicate 2 year (not lifelong) immunity. I\\'m in love with Amy Acton. \"There are most definitely pros and cons to both\"The UK plan will result in thousands of people dying who wouldn\\'t have otherwise.Economic gains will be minimal (If not worse) since the economy isn\\'t just the UK. It\\'s pure Insanity. Stumbled in from the front page. I’m not in the medical field, but this feels so important. I have one meager silver shilling, and you’re getting it kind person. Keep spreading that perspective. It’s massively important in the coming days, weeks, months to not stop spreading this information.I am trying to put myself in the shoes of a healthcare worker, and I know this is something I would need to read too. Love you all, thanks for all you do to keep us safe!  We got this. More so - YOU got this. I’ll do my part in staying home and hope I never have to meet any of you! Ha I did read a theory when this was happening in china that the viral load did influence the severity of illness and they thought this is why young HCWs were becoming seriously ill compared to other young healthy people. Dont know if that has been substantiated, but it makes sense to me. I’m off today but I told my coworkers to print that out and post it everywhere this morning. I don’t know if they did. With the obsession with the stock market and his reported attempt to buy the German company working on a vaccine, there is only a thin veil of pretend leadership hiding the profiteer in chief at this point. Because it looks bad and it\\'s an election year. &gt; It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.The numbers don\\'t really work, though.  There\\'s ~4,000 ICU beds in the UK and the average ventilator time for a Covid-19 patient is around two weeks.  So max they can treat is 8,000 a month or ~80,000 for the remainder of the year.  In a scenario where half the population is infected and 10% need ICU level care that\\'s 3.3 million patients.  So even a perfectly even spread using all available ICU beds, they can treat ~2.4% of the people that need it.  And that\\'s stopping care for everyone else that needs it.  They run around 80% capacity as is, so if we use excess capacity as the number that 2.4% drops to 0.5%.  In a \"everyone gets infected\" scenario we\\'re all pretty fucked and a \"let\\'s get it over with\" plan is probably the best. My spouse is FM (and not on reddit) and is working a COVID tent at a major hospital in a major east coast city. The hospital already has a few dozen covid patients under care.The plan is to use PPE, then come home and  I guess hope for the best. We are both concerned about her contracting and also transmitting to either me or our 6mo son. We have seen anecdotal reports of 10-20% of HCW in Italy contracting, and in this thread about young people (we are both in our 30s) and young doctors essentially dropping dead. Not sure what is real and what isn\\'t.We\\'ve tried to figure out a way for her to quarantine but that is impossible physically as she needs to breast feed our son. Looking for data and experiences of others in similar situations, trying to navigate this. I\\'ll briefly summarize [this interview of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/gesundheit/coronavirus/virologe-hendrik-streeck-ueber-corona-neue-symptome-entdeckt-16681450.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2) broadsheet with Hendrik Streek, head of the virological institute at the University of Bonn, Germany, who has conducted field research on ca. 100 outpatient/home quarantine Covid-19 patients in the Heinsberg District cluster. As soon I see a publication in English, I\\'ll post the link.* 30% of the cases had diarrhea, way higher than in previous reports* Virus RNA found in toilet bowls with no prove of being infectious* A German 15-min rapid test was a failure with a sensitivity of 33% and a specifity of 93%.* A new reported symptom? Loss of smell and tasting.&amp;#8203;    \"Nearly all infected we conducted interviews with - and those were two thirds of all - described a loss of smelling and tasting for multiple days. This went so far that a mother could no longer note the smell of a full diapper of her child. Others could no longer smell their shampoo and food started to taste dull. We cannot say right now when those symptoms start to present but we believe it is at some later point during infection.\" No. There have been isolated reports here and there, but nothing very credible. Seeing as you\\'d need a large population to be re exploded after recovering, and the entire world has less that 7000 recovered people as I write, that\\'s just not possible. This entire tragedy has shined a huge spotlight on America\\'s arrogance. I\\'ve heard so many outrageous responses to taking this seriously that I\\'m already burned out and the worst is still to come.It\\'s like the tide has receded and society is more focused on collecting seashells and IG photos while the tsunami is inevitably about to make landfall.Just this weekend I saw a person, who is a realtor by trade, post that COVID was called an upper respiratory infection in December but the media has now decided to give it a name to incite panic. A realtor posted this theory and it was shared / x-posted and liked by many. https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeonsThis leaves very little wiggle room. Hit me particularly hard I think all you could do is notify Surgical, nursing and hospital leadership regarding the Policy from the American College of Surgeons.https://www.facs.org/about-acs/covid-19/information-for-surgeonsTheir update leaves little to no wiggle room. What is the rationale for NSAIDs in this disease anyway? Just symptomatic control and anti-pyrexia as usual? I\\'m not sure how avoiding NSAIDs would necessarily be bad per-se. Lowly M-1 who wants to know more.Given the events and measures taken yesterday, have we done enough?  Were we too late?  How much flattening of the curve did we really achieve with shutting the schools in NYC, banning restaurants, etc?What can the general population expect in the coming week-2 weeks? What possibly could be? It it truly just slowing the spread is all we can hope for? Share the hotlines on those posts. People should be calling ahead to get instructions, and yes, that night take a while, but this isn\\'t a fast killer for anyone getting turned back. It takes getting I\\'ll and deteriorating in week 2 to need hospital management, that\\'s all time to call the hotline. Got a link? I don\\'t see anything on google news about this. Large healthcare organizations aren\\'t doing WFH due to organizational inertia and \"it\\'s not in our values\".  How can we expect other companies to do it? Such amazing adviceX thanks for sharing Is it because it wasn\\'t implemented soon enough? my god in heaven what are they waiting for.......i really cant believe it at this point Not enough data. Same as ACEi/ARB. And to be fair the same as all the proposed antiviral treatments - we just don’t have firm evidence yet. Everyone thinks that they\\'re the \"special case\" and that they deserve different care than what is recommended for everyone else.  Sorry you have to deal with this. extremely irresponsible. my quaternary level facility has suspended all elective cases with only urgent procedures being done. the surgeon general and the american college of surgeons has said the same. although, i think it would depend on if there were any COVID positive cases in your area as well.  the ITaly situation showed they went from 1 positive to overwhelmed in the matter of weeks It\\'s hard as hell, but it is important to remember the first step of every layperson CPR algorithm is to make sure the area is safe for you before going in. In this case, that means you absolutely take the time needed to make sure you don all your PPE properly. Multiplying victims helps no one. If your team becomes infected, what happens to the next patient that needs you? And the one after that? This seems like the course that is described for young people. Recovery followed by death from myocarditis.

Buy me a hotdog, with, with sauerkraut and onions. The alarming thing is that isolation and shutdown are not thought to be enough to stop this. I am tempted to agree that it\\'s not a good idea, but I\\'m not sold completely by the total lockdown Singaporean style approach either. It works in the v short-term, medium and long term you have to be skeptical. Just a note to say I don\\'t think the UK government want infection rates to \"maximise\" in any sense, they want to manage the rate in the \"unlikely to need ICU\" population (How possible that is, I have no idea). Concurrently, I think they do plan on implementing an asian country style \\'lockdown\\' but just for \"likely to need ICU\" population.As stated previously, I\\'m just trying to ascertain the logic here and am not advocating for any particular approach. There are most definitely pros and cons to both. This came up a few times in this megathread over the weekend, but I\\'ve yet to see any evidence either way -- i.e. that it does or does not make a difference. One person over the weekend said that there was a message going around about a study from the University of Vienna (I think? somewhere in Vienna) that suggested that all of the sickest Italian patients had been taking NSAIDs. But the institution in Vienna immediately debunked that. The French health minister was saying this about NSAIDs. And supposedly it had to do with ACE. But everything floating around is hearsay. I don\\'t know, I have a lot of people asking me about it and I have absolutely no information either way. jeeze im crying I agree that if this strategy has any hope of working, our \"Likely to need ICU admission patients\" need to isolate ASAP and this needs to be enforceable by law. At least 20 something states have cancelled school. Im sure yours will happen at some point this week. Governors having FOMO left and right (for good reason!) I would say the lack of foresight is frightening but we don’t need foresight...look at China, Iran and Italy. Why do we seem to think we are above it? I’m at a loss. The schedules for the rest of the week are even busier. Yea a family friend is having surgery this week. She\\'s almost 60 and has CKD, DM, HTN, etc.  Like why the fuck is this happening?! I\\'ve tried repeatedly to tell her daughter to get her reschedule but she thinks the whole thing isn\\'t a big deal so my concerns are falling on deaf ears. I\\'m trying to figure out why the hospital is doing it anyways. Here in the midwest we haven\\'t been hit hard yet but it\\'s coming and we\\'re gonna need all the PPE for emergent surgeries, not elective shit now. It feels so to me. My hospital is the same. The schedule today has elective add ons! It amazes me. Our OR is filled with elective cases today. No one seems to care here or elsewhere. Why are we ignoring this? This is the truth: years of training and experience cannot be replaced by books. Please make sure the knowledge is passed on Are you suggesting COVID was the cause of his arrest? Can someone, anyone, answer me WHY domestic flights have not been grounded yet? Yeah that too.  Information is power, the right information can have big results with minimum expenditure. I only address misinformation if it is dangerous/harmful.  Otherwise people can do whatever they want.  That cuts out most of the work right there. It\\'s a terrible idea. From what I\\'ve read, ultimately you are going to end up with a massive number infections really regardless. The goal then, is to preserve your hospital capacity and infrastructure by minimizing new cases to a manageable level.The UK instead is going to maximize the infection rate, overwhelm their health care system quickly, and thereby maximize the amount of casualties. They may shorten the duration of their overall outbreak by a few months, at the price of tens of thousands of lives. Oh that’s terrible. Poor guy. Is this the exact reason patient 31 was such a super spreader? From the salt spraying? It was very brutal. Rip xia And he took out the public health career politician bs and just put a straight doctor in charge of who he listens to. Dr acton My hospital is still allowing a ton of elective surgical cases. Is this as irresponsible as I think it is? I feel like I should refuse to participate in elective cases The NSAID thing is going around Facebook fwiw Do we have a conclusive opinion on the post infection immunity ?And well wishes from Africa. Dismantling the NIH pandemic response office should be criminal with these results. Lives are and will be lost,  not even mentioning economic impacts. Leadership should be held accountable by the people but it seems like we are too far gone for that in this country. I think this is what they are going for as well.I am extremely skeptical for multiple reasons. Firstly, the virus has proven itself extremely contagious. They are not currently doing anything to prevent its spread, and elderly people are not forced into self isolation. So...it\\'s spreading like wildfire right now through every age group. Personally I feel this will overwhelm the NHS within 2-3 weeks.They\\'re also playing a dangerous game with trying to infect the \"healthy\" people as that will still come at a cost - 25 year olds still die of Covid-19. They are less likely to die, but doesn\\'t change the fact that they are certainly sacrificing lives for this \"herd immunity.\"I am also skeptical of herd immunity. Is there any evidence that you even develop immunity to this virus? There have been multiple reports of people who have been positive, then get better and are negative, becoming positive again.  Plus it seems that just like influenza it would be easy for a slightly different strain to come around and make though thousands to hundreds of thousands of people you let die for her immunity utterly pointless.Another interesting thought I saw brought up is that since most other countries are going for the total lockdown eradication route, does this not mean they will have to stop all travel to and from the UK for the foreseeable future? Our current plan is let everyone get infected. If the plan continues for a year, which they think it will, surely that means any country that has stopped the virus via isolation would not allow someone from a country letting it run free come in.Overall, I see why they are trying to mitigate economic effects. I just can\\'t get behind the plan, and I do not see the NHS coping for very long. Well, not all countries have factories making ppe under their command.Now my Utopia on Earth has a strong advanced Heath system and manufacture everything so no imports. Anyone would like to add to my Utopia ? We all need this reminder.  Thank you. Thank you for this. It becomes very concerning when all over the US, we are running out of PPE very quickly. We may get more in the long term but in the short term, the decisions are even more difficult right access to proper PPE. So CDC is recommending no gatherings of 50+ people, yet schools do not count. Why? As of right now schools in my district are planning to open next week after spring break. Why are we not doing a full lockdown? Cases are increasing rapidly yet we\\'re pussy footing around and letting people do whatever they want to a large degree. It\\'s so frustrating that we\\'ve seen the results of dragging feet from China and Italy and think we will magically not have the same outcomes. &gt; What has happened to America?It was made great.I know we prefer shying away from politics, but this fish rotted from the head from day 1. My wife is going through the same thing.Very disheartening to her when the people who brag about her to their friends, completely ignore the topic they brag about. Guess what news channel is on 24/7?We\\'re going to try one more time tonight. We\\'re hoping we can spin it as we need them to set an example for those around because this is a dangerous situation for my wife. &gt;I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.Wait, what?*Clicks link*...Oh. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infectionThis article states that NSAIDS are supposedly worsening the symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Is there any pathophysiological understanding of why that is? Typically NSAIDS can cause damage to the GI system or renal system, how can it worsen respiratory symptoms? I have been very intrigued by the seemingly slow UK response and the reasons behind it. Having had a think, I think the reason may be about finding a compromise between the health and financial impacts of the pandemic: If non vulnerable people contract the virus (20-50 year olds, no comorbidities) they are unlikely to need ICU admission. Therefore we are not v worried about them getting it. In fact, we want them to get it at a steady rate so we can get them back to being fully fledged members of the economy: working, purchasing etc. They get the virus, they self-isolate for a period and then ideally behave normally. This will be facilitated by widespread rapid home-testing kits, production of which is being accelerated as we speak. Meanwhile we hide away the vulnerable (this group will be defined further in the next few days ie not just over 70s) as they are the ICU admission risk. They are locked away until the Ro drops below one due to the development of \"herd immunity\". I believe the economic risk is the reason for the aversion to a \"lockdown\" type strategy, not negligence.Any thoughts? Agreements/Disagreements?I don\\'t think this is necessarily the correct response but I think its what they are going for. My shop began creating cohort units yesterday. ICU, stepdown, med/surg. Shit\\'s getting real now.Facebook meme status report: less \"it\\'s just flu\" and more \"kids staying at home is the end of my life\". St. Florence Nightingale posting remains hot. Toilet paper memes growing tired and losing value, but still pushed hard by Facebook neophytes. Our government has called for a voluntary ban on gatherings that church services would fit into. However, I think there would be a literal armed revolt if the government tried to actually ban church services. Interesting video about what Nanjing has done to stop the spread:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsdJGj3-jMBiggest things I see are temperature check points everywhere, masks everywhere, and lots of little sensible things like tissue to touch the elevator buttons and not allowing face to face seating at restaurants.  I\\'m also sure it will warm everyone\\'s heart to see that fast food workers in China have better PPE than medical workers here. So what\\'s the deal with NSAIDs?  Good, Bad, Not enough data? Or spending $0.00 to make an announcement directing people to isolate themselves. # Current Covid-19 stats:  * Total reported cases: 173,833  * Total reported deaths: 6,680 * Total reported recoveries: 77,826 * Estimated death rate: 3.84 u/Number_Bot !Coronavirus Christ, that was brutal. not 2T into masks and ventilators, mind you I honestly don\\'t understand people sometimes.  There is a TON of information out there that unless if you are incredibly sick, don\\'t come in to the ED just to see if you have coronavirus.  Even if you have a known exposure, if your symptoms are mild, you are to call either the state hotline or the hotlines set up by the major health systems near me.  But last night we still got multiple people calling in saying they needed to be seen because they wanted to know if they had the coronavirus.  For one of them, my nurse basically asked them if they thought it was a good idea to come in and expose all of us if they did have it, or if they should just call the hotline like is recommended.  They basically said they didn\\'t know if the hotline open during the middle of the night... hopefully your husband\\'s boss is pressured to implement WFH, and soon This is so infuriating. You are so correct about our need for meaningful code discussions ahead of time. I’ll have to look on SHM if they have recommendations but it may be something for rounders to discuss daily. Thanks for the response. Stay safe! This post is for my healthcare workers, docs, surgeons, Nurses, aids, and ems, but also support staff.There is no emergency in a pandemicYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you\\'re going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You\\'re going to have to put your needs first.I\\'m speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.If you\\'re an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed)But your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves.You stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.You going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any  patients in the weeks your laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.People are going to die. Do not become one of them. There is no emergency in a pandemic.During the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter, before going in. If we didn\\'t have proper PPE we did NOT go in.There is no emergency in a pandemic.You may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPEThere is no emergency in a pandemic.You may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.There is no emergency in a pandemic.You may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.There is no emergency in a pandemic.A self qaurentined patient has a gun shot wound and is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPEThere is no emergency in a pandemic Many of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn\\'t be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient. Liberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.Then they became infected, they infected others. And they died.  They didn\\'t help anyone after that.Do not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten. I live in Ohio. I’m not a fan of Mike DeWine, but he has been excellent thus far. Leading the way in shutting down sporting events, schools, restaurants, and bars. I expect a complete state shutdown in the next day or two. Everything he has done has been backed by his head of the Ohio Department of Health. The federal government has sucked. Some state governments are doing a good job. When I used to counsel and people would bring these things up, I would encourage them to really do their own in depth research into it... really look into who is \"conducting\" the research and who is \"publishing\" the info- oftentimes it is the company themselves or a company they\\'re paying so there\\'s a financial incentive to make things look good- that line sometimes gets some people thinking. Bringing up the fact that there\\'s no one actually vetting the product and some studies have shown that many supplements dont actually contain the amount they claim on the bottle occasionally helps (not as much as you would think). Explaining that treatment plans are very tailored to the individual and these people dont actually set what\\'s going on with the pt or what they\\'re taking may interact/cause side effects with their meds or disease state may also rope some people.  Things that hit home are when you can relate the situation to something the patient can understand. One of my faves is, \"would you turn to an accountant (or your Aunt Jane) to give you advice on how to fix your car? No, so why take the chance with your body?\" In the case of Dr. Oz, \"how comfortable would you feel asking a heart surgeon to operate on your brain?\" (or something related to the patient\\'s field of work- \"Would you ask the guy who only does oil changes on passenger cars to fix your big rig?\"). Yikes. Only consolidation I can offer is there\\'s about a 98% chance that flight will not be permitted come Saturday. That’s rough.  Code discussions with patients have never been so important.Crash carts around suspected should have PPE in their IMHO.Italy intubates early, as they have seen a fairly predictable pattern of aggressive crumping after a few days of illness You have to allow people a little leeway to engage in bullshit. These are stressful times and people will often double down on vices to manage that stress. If homeopathic bullshit is their jam then they’ll probably look to that. I think the main question is whether the horse shit treatment is harmful or not. For example if someone is taking high levels of an herb/mineral/etc that can cause other health problems to arise, or if they are not taking proper precautions and exposing themselves to risky situations because they think they are immune or whatever. The bottom line is to stress the fact that we know very little about this virus and there is no currently recognized cure(homeopathic or otherwise) and that all of us still need to practice proper sanitation and social distancing. Bars were packed on Saturday night in Boston despite everyone being urged to self-isolate. Now our governor has issued restrictions limiting restaurants and bars to take-out orders only. I fear it\\'s already too late. Gatherings are now limited to 25 people, but my husband still has to go to work in an engineering office with a lot more people than that. Everything is confusion. Have any experts discussed how in the future we can determine how long the social distancing measures and other efforts need to last? Right now we probably can\\'t know how long this needs to go on because we don\\'t know exactly how it\\'s going to spread, but as the weeks and months roll by how can we determine that we have effectively flattened the curve and we can start going back to business as usual?What sort of measures will they be looking at - total number of current and resolved cases? Daisychaining of ventilators in Vegas during the shooting - 8 patients per vent.

I’ve barely worked at the place a year but the more senior nurses have quit and I’m known as a smarty-pants who they will look to for guidance.Facility is a 23 hr institution so only day chairs for napping, no beds, communal bathrooms and showers. Barely any PPE. No true isolation rooms whatsoever. Patients are usually two to a room so the best we could do is keep 1 patient to a room at a time... but there’s only 8 rooms. Max capacity is 17 for the entire unit.We get patients who are walk-ins, police drop-offs from the community, and referrals from hospitals. Leadership is struggling to find the right balance of staff safety, patient safety, and infection prevention. Our population and frequent flyers include a lot of older homeless people with chronic coughs. (Fuck.)I have suggested the following:Patients cleared by the hospital must present as afebrile and cough, if present, must be infrequent and the patient needs to be coherent enough to know to cover with his elbow and follow up with hand washing.Patients from the community (including police drop-offs) may enter through the back constables office where we have a separate shower. The patient will be checked for fever and cough; if cleared by nursing, the patient must immediately shower and change into our paper scrubs. Temperatures are checked twice each shift on EVERYONE.The problem we run into is that our population is not always compliant. Already, we had a schizophrenic from home enter in a catatonic state whose arms/legs were rigid and we couldn’t change him into scrubs, let alone shower him. Then he tried to run out the door and needed a B52 so then we got to keep him, yay.Thoughts? Advice? Help. What’s the safest I can keep my psych cuties and my co-workers? LOL What do you mean done nothing? They cut the short interest rate to zero and injected $2T into the markets. /s Seeing posts shared on the lovely Facebook about people trying to get tested in the US and being turned away with a giant hospital bill. I know people here were discussing that this whole thing should increase the population’s trust in the medical system but I’m worried that’s going to completely backfire. Heard about a 35 year old  intensivist dying in Indianapolis yesterday with OOHCA after his shift caring for multiple critically ill patients. Thoughts are with his family and colleagues. I’ve spent way too much of my time over the last several days fighting misinformation among my friends on Facebook (I even reactivated my account to do it). I don’t have a canned response but I’m just trying to calmly point out inaccuracies and include links. I’ve even included some journal links when it seemed appropriate, rather than press or things written for lay readers. IME the real essential oils people (who don’t overlap a ton with the Goop people, the latter being a richer and more educated crowd IME) aren’t reachable. But the people who just dabble in whatever they hear about are often happy right now to hear from a doctor who knows what they’re saying. I try to stick only to facts but I do get asked advice and I only give with a lot of caveats and also I keep saying the facts are the best I have but some might be wrong and I’ll update if they are. It’s a complicated line between seeming expert enough for people to take me seriously and making sure I don’t say anything that isn’t true or good advice. I was wondering this as well Question. Attended my first RRT for a patient under precautions with test results pending that night (came back positive today). Severe respiratory distress that happened extremely fast as we waited way too long for PPE. How is everyone stocking crash carts and RSI kits? Our N-95 stock is under lock and key with the house supervisor so no masks were present and PAPR was not on floor. Initially called a code and I cannot imagine if they were truly in cardiac arrest because it took 5+ minutes to get the bare minimum of PPE. It was honestly shocking how fast they went downhill and I never want to be staring at someone threw a window going into that level of distress and anxiety again and not be able to do something because PPE isn’t readily available. I’m trying my best to fight misinformation in my social media circle. Breaking down medical stuff for the layperson in a calm, polite way is my jam. However, when I encounter folks advocating or inquiring about Goop/Dr. Oz “remedies” like essential oils, I struggle.  Obviously, telling these folks that their remedy is horseshit would likely lead to them doubling down on said horseshit.    Does anyone have any good ideas for this situation? Would love to put together a canned response I can tweak as needed. (I know I probably won’t change these people’s minds, but would like a measured response that won’t inflame them, and would leave the door open to further education.) That picture of Magic Kingdom last night is deeply unsettling. The airport photos concerned me but those people were mostly stuck unwittingly. The fact that so many people chose to go to Magic Kingdom, though . . . Is that really from last night? they still basically have not done jack shit up to this point I don’t work in the medical field but my brother is an ER doctor(hasn’t seen any COVID19 cases yet to the best of my knowledge), but these reports of ER doctors falling critically ill has me worried. Is the reason why these doctors fell critically ill just the luck of the draw from contracting the virus itself? Or are medical workers at a higher risk for severe cases because they may be exposed to heavier viral loads if they are around lots of people with the virus all day? I saw someone suggesting the latter on a tv show I watched about the doctor in Wuhan who sounded the alarm and then died(he was only in his 30s). Though I have some suspicions that his real cause of death may be the Chinese communist party. If your country hasn\\'t yet banned gatherings of people in the dozens, especially churches, make sure they do!Here in South Korea we\\'re starting to get over the SCJ cult cluster but now we have multiple small clusters linked to churches. One church sprayed salt water into the mouths of attendees in the belief that it would kill the virus. Of course people coughed onto the nozzle when the salt water hit their tonsils and there are now 40+ cases linked to that church/facepalm This is why the government has to step in and force shit to be shut down. A considerable portion of the population will ignore the warnings and recommendations, and in a situation like this you really need full compliance. I started wondering this last night myself. Came across this [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html?fbclid=IwAR3cjqojQTsW4wPmETYoNkywPuNXSUDNXy5ronkb9nouuV165RNoJbZRhYE) profiling two 29 year old HCWs from China- one doctor and one nurse- and their trajectory after being diagnosed. It\\'s a sobering reminder that although some of us may not fall into higher risk categories,  it\\'s still important to protect ourselves as much as possible in the coming days. I saw a great quote this week that summed up this feeling for me “a week ago, no one had heard of coronavirus or an epidemiologist and now everyone is an expert in viral epidemiology.” It’s on both extremes, panickers and deniers couldn’t care that you might actually know something factual as an MD. I need to rant. My wife is being induced tomorrow. Her parents are still planning to go to Cabo on Saturday. I’ve told them virus danger, bringing it to their elderly parents, border lockdown (turning 1 week into 3+) and also how they aren’t to see us for 2 weeks after being on US soil. Totally unfazed. Usual boomer responses- it’s the flu, I feel fine, I’ve lost enough money in the market don’t wanna lose the trip, and the more infuriating ‘you work in a hospital, i think that’s more dangerous’. I’m so beyond pissed. I’m pissed that MDs have lost their authority in this country. Any idiot can put whatever they want on FB, do whatever they want with their bodies and it’s all ok. Question concerning surfactant application:  As far as I know surfactant has proven ineffective in \"usual\" adult septic ARDS due to the complexity of the problem. However I just read that sars-coV-2 attacks the surfactant producing type 2 pneumocytes. Considering the fast pacing collapse of alveolae wouldn\\'t a (possibly repeated) application of surfactant aerosol help keeping them open?   Does anybody know wether this is being reevaluated?

However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: “It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.”&gt; The document also states that:&gt; * The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are “under significant demand pressures”.&gt; * From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.&gt; * Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.This isn\\'t necessarily the most likely scenario, but it\\'s rough reading - but also probably a lot more realistic than some other countries are willing to consider at this stage.* Speaking of other countries not taking this as seriously, Trump held a press conference yesterday evening where, among other things, [he said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/trump-coronavirus-relax-were-doing-great-expert-worst-to-come):&gt; “Relax, we’re doing great,” he said, during short, meandering comments that focused mostly on celebrating a decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “It all will pass.” “Have a nice dinner, relax,” the president added.&gt; The president’s remarks stood in marked contrast to his lead infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who used the same conference to warn: “The worst is ahead for us”, describing the crisis as reaching a “very, very critical point now”.* I think it\\'s pretty obvious that I disapprove of the way that Trump has handled this crisis so far, and don\\'t want these posts to become repetitive bashing of the US administration since that doesn\\'t really help the average medditor care for patients. But, as I\\'ve also said, public health pandemic response is an [inherently political](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fdf31j/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_4th_2020/fjgyc08/) matter and improvement to the [current response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html) might affect outcomes - and might better inform the response to the [next pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest):&gt; After the debate, which Trump deemed “VERY boring”, his campaign operation accused the candidates of “plagiarizing” the president’s response to coronavirus, which it described as “a model for all future pandemics”.* Jack Ma, co-founder of China\\'s enormous Alibaba, is [donating masks and testing kits to the USA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/jack-ma-joins-twitter-with-first-tweet-on-mask-donation-to-u-s). Yes, things are bad enough in the USA, that poor, underdeveloped, and disadvantaged country that had absolutely no forewarning about an imminent pandemic /s, that Chinese philanthropists are donating vast quantities of relief supplies. *What has happened to America?** We\\'re hearing [confirmation](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-confirms-that-donald-trump-tried-to-buy-firm-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine/) from Germany that Trump tried to [buy exclusive American](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html) access to a vaccine; things got a bit heated and there seems to be more going on [under the surface](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal):&gt; Last week, the firm mysteriously announced that CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella had been replaced by Ingmar Hoerr, just weeks after Menichella met Trump, his vice-president Mike Pence and representatives of pharma companies in Washington.The German interior crisis committee will be discussing this urgently today and we\\'ll see what they have to say.* Baltimore has a great public health campaign about social distancing [here](https://twitter.com/AlecMacGillis/status/1239360166350532608). We need similarly impactful messaging globally ASAP.* Australia is [running short](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent) of PCR reagent just as it seems to be reaching an exponential inflection point:&gt; The Australian Medical Association has warned a common reagent that is critical in the testing of coronavirus is facing supply issues because of the huge demand on Australian laboratories due to Covid-19.South Australia has a small stockpile which may need to be carefully redistributed.* New York governor Andrew Cuomo has written an [opinion piece in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-trump.html) urging more drastic action, including use of active duty military personnel to aid in expanding hospital capacity - in echoes of what China did.* Leaving on a lighter note, here\\'s a [message of hope](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1239383795205169152) from Arnold Schwarzenegger. I literally have no idea why he has tiny horses.* And for those of you who have always wanted to see young, muscular rugby players washing their balls to help prevent COVID-19 spread (and who hasn\\'t **always** wanted that?!), [you\\'re in luck](https://twitter.com/KennyBania_/status/1239063570228232192).
